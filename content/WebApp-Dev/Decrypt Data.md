# Decrypt Data

On the *[Decrypt](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Decrypt.htm)* page, users can
perform an ad hoc decryption of encrypted data. For instance, when
reviewing data in SQL, a user may need to know the value of one of the
encrypted columns. The user could paste the encrypted value into this
page to view the decrypted value.

The *Decrypt* page can also be used to test the decryption process to
ensure it is working and set up correctly.

To perform ad hoc decryption:

1.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Encryption \> Decrypt** in the
    *Navigation* pane.
2.  Paste the encrypted data into the **ENCRYPTED DATA** field.
3.  Click **Save**.
4.  Click **Show**.
5.  The decrypted data displays as a notification.
