# Monitor Requests

Two reports are provided to facilitate the monitoring of requests:

  - Active Requests
  - All Requests

**NOTE**: All requests, except those in a status of Finished, Cancelled
or Deleted, display.

These reports display the current status, added on dates and current
progress of the role processing.
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Click the Users icon on
either report to view a list of users who have access to the template
upon which the request is based on the *Template Role Users Monitor*
page.</span>

To monitor a request, select a report from **Configuration\> Reports**
on the *Navigation* pane.

To view debug logs to assist while troubleshooting posting errors, in
Common, select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Monitor \> Debug
Logs</span>. Refer to Common documentation on [Configure Debug Logs
Settings](../../../Platform/Common/Use_Cases/Configure_Debug_Logs_Settings)
and [View Debug
Logs](../../../Platform/Common/Use_Cases/View_Debug_Logs) for more
information.
