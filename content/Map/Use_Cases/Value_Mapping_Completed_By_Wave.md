# Value Mapping Completed by Wave

This chart displays the number of value mappings that are in process and
the number that are complete for all check tables in the Wave selected
on the Value Mapping by Wave and Process Area chart (accessed from
Console) or the Wave and Process Area in the Context bar (accessed from
Map).

Hover a cursor over the Completed section to view the count of Completed
value mappings for the Wave. A value mapping is completed after it has
been mapped on the <span style="font-style: italic;">[Value Mapping
(Legacy to
Target)](../Page_Desc/Value_Mapping_Legacy_to_Target_H.htm)</span> page.

Hover a cursor over the In Process section to view the count of in
process value mappings for the Wave. A value mapping status is In
Process if a field on a check table has not been mapped and the NOT
RELEVANT check box is disabled on the Value Mapping (Legacy to Target)
page.

Click a bar to open the <span style="font-style: italic;">[Value
Mapping](../Page_Desc/Value_Mapping.htm)</span> page to view the status
of each check tableâ€™s value mapping. The MAPPED PERCENT field displays
the mapping status for each check table.
