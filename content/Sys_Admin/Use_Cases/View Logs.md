# View Logs

When logging is enabled, the DSP tracks every page event and every time
a page is accessed and logs this information daily in a .CSV file,
unless logging for a page has been disabled.

The logs are stored in a data source defined on the
*[Parameters](../Page_Desc/Parameters_All_TabsSysAdmin.htm)* page on the
Logging Options tab.

To download the current daily log, click the **Download Most Recent Log
File** icon on the Logging Options tab.
