# Send a Temporary Password to a New User

A new user needs a password in order to log in. An Administrator sends
an email to the user containing a temporary password.

The user creation email sent to the user states that their DSP® account
password has been created with a temporary password. The email contains
a link for the user to set their new password.

Before this task is performed, the user must be created. Refer to
[Create a User Account in Common](Create_a_User.htm) for more
information.

To send a temporary password to a user:

1.  Select **Common \> User Management** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Select a user ID.
3.  Click the **Set Password and Notify User Password** icon; a message
    displays.
4.  Click **OK**.

When the user is first created, the user receives the “user creation”
email. Subsequent times the **Set Password and Notify User Password**
icon is clicked for the user (whether the user has logged in or not), a
“password reset” email is sent. Refer to [Reset a User's
Password](Reset%20a%20User's%20Password.htm) for more information.

Continue with [Assign a User to a Security Role in
Common](Assign_a_User_to_a_Security_Role_in_Common.htm).
