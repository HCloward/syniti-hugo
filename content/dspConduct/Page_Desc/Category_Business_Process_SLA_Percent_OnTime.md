# Category, Business Process SLA Percent On Time

When a request is submitted, a due date for each of the request’s roles
is calculated based on the Work Days, Hours and Minutes SLA settings for
the role. As request roles are finished, new due dates are calculated
for subsequent roles whose dependencies are complete.  When charts are
produced, these due dates are used to determine the percent on time
values for the specific design element (i.e., category, business
process, scenario, or role) being viewed.

This chart displays the percentage of roles by specific business
processes within the category completed on time according to established
SLA settings based on active requests. Refer to [Set Up SLA
Notifications in dspConduct™](../Config/Set_Up_SLA_Notifications.htm)
for more information.

Refer to [View Charts in dspConduct™](../Use_Cases/View_Charts.htm) for
general information about chart features.

Click a bar in the chart to drill down to the [Business Process,
Scenario SLA Percent On
Time](Business_Process_Scenario_SLA_Percent_OnTime.htm) chart.
