# View Resource Charts in System Administration

The resource charts in System Administration display a series of charts
to help monitor the status, health, wait time and run time of the
following resource types:

  - **Background Event –** The background service controls the job queue
  - **General –** The job is on the General queue
  - **Index –** The job is on the Index queue
  - **Service Page –** The associated Service page controls the job
    queue

The View Data icon to the right of a chart name opens a pane that
displays the alternate text descriptions of chart data in a table.

Hover a cursor over each section of a bar to view the field count.
