# Register Users to Groups

Users gain access to reports by being a member of a group. Once users
are registered to a group, they are able to receive reports through a
workflow email and configure report settings.

A single report can be registered to multiple groups. Users are not able
to view or configure reports until user security has been granted to a
group.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: Only a groups owner can
add users to a group.

To register a user to a group:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Groups** in *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **User** for Group.

3.  Click **Add**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Group Users
    page](../Page_Desc/Group_Users)

4.  Select a user from **USER ID** list box.
    
    **NOTE:** The User ID list box displays all users who have access to
    dspMonitor™ through System Administration. Refer to the System
    Administration documentation for detailed information on granting
    user security to dspMonitor™.

5.  Click **Save**.
