# Set the Default Queue for a Job Type

The DSPÂ® is delivered with Job Types that categorize jobs as Background
Event, General, Index or Service Page. Each Job Type is associated with
a queue which groups similar jobs to run together.

A user cannot delete or add Job Types, but can update the default queue.

To configure the default queue:

1.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Setup \> Job Types** in the
    **Navigation** pane.
2.  Click **Edit** for a job status type.
3.  Select an option in the **DEFAULT QUEUE** list box.
4.  Click **Save**.
