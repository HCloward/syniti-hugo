# Add Distributions to a Project

Each project in ISA must have at least one Distribution. The
Distribution Owner is the primary contact of information for the data
quality rules configured in the Distribution.

When the Distribution is created, the Distribution Owner is
automatically registered as a user for the Distribution.

**NOTE**: A project can have multiple Distributions.

To add a Distribution:

1.  Select **Information Steward Accelerator \> Configuration \> Project
    Summary** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Distributions** for a project.
    
    **NOTE**: If no records exist, the page displays in add mode.
    Otherwise click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span>.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Project Distributions
    page.](../Page_Desc/Project_Distributions_H)

3.  Enter a unique name for the Distribution in the **DISTRIBUTION**
    field.

4.  Select a user name in the **DISTRIBUTIONOWNER** list box.
    
    **NOTE**: This list contains all active users registered to ISA.
    
    **NOTE**: Each Distribution can have only one Distribution Owner.

5.  Click **Save**.
