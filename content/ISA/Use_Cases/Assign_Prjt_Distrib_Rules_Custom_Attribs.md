# Assign Project Distribution Rules using Custom Attributes

Custom attributes, such as Priority or Business Owner, are user-defined
descriptions that can be applied to rules. These attributes are added in
Information Steward and assigned to a rule that is registered in the
ISA. Attributes are used to organize and assign rules to project
distribution and display in workflow templates.

Once tables are refreshed in Collect, the custom attributes will display
in the ISA. Refer to [Refresh
Tables](../../../Platform/Collect/Use_Cases/Refresh_Overview.htm#Refresh_Tables)
for more information.
