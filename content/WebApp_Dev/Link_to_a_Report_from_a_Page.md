# Link to a Report from a Page

Images and buttons can be added to columns to be used as links to
reports. By default, page links render data using the normal Horizontal
or Vertical View with add/edit/delete capability. Link to Report
provides a mechanism to access a page as read only, even if that page
allows add, edit or delete capabilities. The user does not have to
modify the defaulted page properties.

To link to a report:

1.  <span id="Column Properties Navigation" class="popUpLink">Access the
    *Page Columns* page</span>'s *Vertical* View for the control that
    will link to the report.

2.  Click **Edit**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Page Columns
    page](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Page_Columns_H)*

3.  Click the report name to link to from the selected page in **Link to
    Page ID** field; the *Page Column Links* page displays.

4.  Click the **Link to Report** check box.

5.  Navigate back to the *Page Columns* page's *Vertical* View.

6.  Click **Save**.
