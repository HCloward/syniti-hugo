# Monthly Summary By Object

This chart displays the number of mappings per status for all field
mappings for all targets in the object selected on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Objects](../Page_Desc/Objects_map)</span>
page for the month. The number in the x-axis is the number of the month
in the year. For example, 2014-01 is January of 2014.

The Total Mappings is the count of active fields in the target.

Hover a cursor over a data point to view the number of field mappings in
that status for the object for that month.

Click the line for an object to drill down to the
*[Targets](../Page_Desc/Targets_H_Map)* page to view the
targets that are in the object. 

Refer to [View Dashboards in Map](View_Dashboards_in_Map) for
