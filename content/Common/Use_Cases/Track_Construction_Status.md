# Track Construction Status

To track status, certain conditions must be met:

  - The page must have been autogenerated when the {Full Construction}
    Target Source was added in Target Design. If a user updates the page
    ID on the *Vertical* View of the *Target Source* page in the
    Construction Page ID field indicating a custom page is to be used
    for the Construct page, no metrics will be tracked for the
    construction status on the custom page.
  - The default WebApp (Construct) and Source data source
    (sdbdspConstruct) must be retained. If either of these have been
    changed, metrics tracking will not be performed. Refer to [Update
    the WebApp and Source Data Source for
    Construct](../../../Migration/Console/Use_Cases/Update_Construct_WebApp_and_Data_Source.htm)
    for more information.

Metrics track:

  - The number of records in the Source data source for the Source table
  - The number of records that are complete based on the site
    requirements for a record to be complete on each page.

A summary page of this information can be accessed from Target Design
and Console. Refer to Â [View Dashboard in
Construct](../../../Migration/Construct/Use_Cases/View_Dashboard_in_Construct.htm)
for more information.

**NOTE**: A service page runs every few hours to update the statistics
for total, estimated and completed records that display on charts and
pages. The update process can also be run manually. Refer to [Update
Completed Status of Records for a Construction
Page](../../../Migration/Construct/Use_Cases/Update_Completed_Status_of_Records.htm)
for more information.

**NOTE**: If a user selects the Manual Construction action in Map for a
field, the construction is to be performed without any automation. Once
the page has been added and the conditions to track status have been
met, a manual construction page will also be included in metrics
tracking.
