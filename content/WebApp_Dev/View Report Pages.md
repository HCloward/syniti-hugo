# View Report Pages

WebApps can have a **Reports** option in the *Navigation* pane that
displays all Report pages registered to the WebApp. In addition, a
Dynamic page can link to a Report page. For example, the *Customers*
page contains a link to the *Order History Report* page. In this
example, the Order History Report link is a Dynamic-to-Report page link.

To view reports registered to a WebApp:

1\. Select **Report** in the *Navigation* pane.

2\. Click a Report link to view the report.
