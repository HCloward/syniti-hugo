# Guidelines for Vertical Page Views

The *Vertical* View should contain the columns on the *Horizontal* View
and all additional columns. Additional properties can be applied to
organize the *Vertical* View to eliminate vertical scrolling.

When creating a *Vertical* Page View:

  - Make the first column(s) in the view the keys from the table that
    will be registered to the page to which the *Vertical* View is
    assigned.
  - Add columns in an order so that the workflow of the page processes
    from top to bottom.
  - Include all field outputs in the *Horizontal* View assigned to the
    same page as the *Vertical* View, if applicable.
  - Organize data groups into tabs so that each page does not require
    excessive vertical scrolling or to provide categorical grouping.
  - Separate logical groups of data in a tab using labels.
  - Use the naming convention **webXXXVer**, where **XXX** is the name
    of the table.
  - The name of the underlying table, which will be registered to the
    page, must be included in the name of the view.
