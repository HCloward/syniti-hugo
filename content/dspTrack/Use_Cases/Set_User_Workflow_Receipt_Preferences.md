# Set User Workflow Receipt Preferences

By default, users receive workflow messages from dspTrack™ via email and
notification from within the DSP®.

A user can change workflow receipt preferences for that user’s account
only. Workflow messages can be received via email, a notification in the
DSP®, or both.

**NOTE**: By default, a service page runs every five minutes to check
for workflow updates and to send a notification to the users assigned to
the Plan Tasks and Work List Items that have been updated..

To set user preferences:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Workflow \> User Preference** from
    *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Edit**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Workflow User Preference
    page](../Page_Desc/Workflow_Preferences)

3.  Select an option in the **MESSAGE TYPE ID** list box.
    
    **NOTE**: Values are:
    
      - Track Alert: Email and Message
      - Track Alert: Email Only
      - Track Alert: Message Only

4.  Click **Save**.
