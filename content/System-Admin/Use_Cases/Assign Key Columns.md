# Assign Key Columns

By default the database schema is analyzed to determine which columns
are primary key columns. Primary key columns are used to associate
indexed words to specific records. If indexing a table that does not
have a primary key constraint defined or a view, a primary key column
must be manually defined.

To define a column as a primary key:

1.  Select **Admin \> WebApps** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Pages** for a WebApp.

3.  Click the **Column Properties** icon for the page with the key
    column.

4.  Click **Vertical View** for the key column.

5.  Click **Edit**.
    
    [*View the field descriptions for the Page Columns page's Vertical

6.  Click the **Advanced Properties** tab.

7.  Click the **Key** check box to mark it as the primary key.

8.  Click **Save**.
