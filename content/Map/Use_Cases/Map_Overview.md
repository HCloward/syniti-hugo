# Map Overview

Map is a strategic component of dspMigrateâ„¢ that facilitates the process
of mapping for a Target system implementation. Map and Target Design are
used to document the design and mapping phases of a migration project.
Once [Targets](../../Design/Use_Cases/Add_a_Target_in_Target_Design)
and [Sources](../../Design/Use_Cases/Assign_a_Source_to_a_Target)
are created in Target Design and the [Design is synced with
Map](../../Design/Use_Cases/Sync_Map_and_Target_Design_TD), Targets
and Sources are pushed to Map where [field
mapping](Perform_Field_Mapping) and [value
mapping](Perform_Value_Mapping_Overview) can be performed.

After the mapper has configured a field mapping, it is submitted and
must be approved by a Developer on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Mapping
Approval](../Page_Desc/Mapping_Approval_H)</span> page. Refer to
[Approve or Reject Field Mappings](Approve_or_Reject_Mappings) for
more information.

Since the mapping process can change at various times during the
implementation, Map is a key component within dspMigrate for capturing
and tracking requirements, customer decisions and specifications to
provide accurate mapping information.

Rules created in Map can then be auto-generated.

## Setup and Configuration for Map

Before getting started with Map, verify the following steps have been
completed:

1.  [Set Up Security for
    Map](../../dspMigrate/Set_Up_Security_for_dspMigrate)

2.  [Set Up System Types for the Legacy
    System](Set_up_a_System_Type_for_the_Legacy_System)

3.  [Download Tables](Download_Tables_Map)

4.  [Set up User Notifications](../Config/Setup_User_Notifications)

Refer to [Access Map](../Config/Access_Map) for information about
accessing the component.
