# Add a Style

This task is performed by users with System Administrator privileges.
Styles add color and depth to a site. When multiple sites are used, they
can be utilized to aid users in differentiating which site is being used
by applying a different style setting to each site.

To add a style in System Administration:

1.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Style \> Styles** in the
    *Navigation* pane; the *Styles* page displays.

2.  Click **Add**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Styles
    page](../Page_Desc/Styles_H)*

3.  Enter a value in the **DESCRIPTION** field.
    
    **NOTE:** The value entered represents the color and appearance the
    pages will have once the style is applied. Enter a name that
    describes the color and appearance of the style.

4.  Click **Save**.
