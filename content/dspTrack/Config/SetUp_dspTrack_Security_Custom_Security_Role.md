# Set Up dspTrack™ Security for Custom Security Roles

To set up security for dspTrack™ for security roles not delivered, an
Administrator:

1.  Creates User Accounts
2.  Creates Security Roles
3.  Assigns Users to Security Role
4.  Assigns WebApp Groups to Security Role  

A user can then:

5.  [Create projects and plans in
    dspTrack](../Use_Cases/Organize_Plans_with_Projects).  

An Administrator can then:

6.  Assign the security key for the newly created projects and plans to
    the security role.

**NOTE**: An Administrator must assign security keys to a role every
time a new project and plan is created in dspTrack™.

Users can also be granted or denied access to a specific plan. Refer to
[Set Plan Security](Set_Plan_Security) for more information.
