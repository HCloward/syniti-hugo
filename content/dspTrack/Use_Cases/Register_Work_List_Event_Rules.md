# Register Work List Event Rules

Work List Event rules can be registered at the [Work
List](Register_WorkList_Event_Rules_WorkList_Item.htm),
[Plan](Register_Work_List_Event_Rules_for_a_Plan.htm), and [Plan
Task](Register_Work_List_Event_Rules_for_a_Plan_Task.htm) level and
[tag](Configure_Logic_Tags.htm) level, and can be set to run when work
on a task starts or completes.

The event rule is triggered when a user clicks the Next Action button on
the Work List to indicate that work on the task has started or finished.

Before registering the rule, it must be written and stored in a data
source that is registered in Common. Refer to [Register a Data Source in
Common](../../Common/Use_Cases/Register_a_Data_Source_in_Common.htm) for
more information. The rule can only use parameters that can be passed in
from the Work List. Refer to [Parameters for Work List Event
Rules](../Page_Desc/Parameters_for_Work_List_Event_Rules.htm) Â for more
information.
