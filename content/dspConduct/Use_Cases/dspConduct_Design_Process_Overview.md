# dspConduct™ Design Process Overview

A governance hierarchy consists of the following elements:

  - A category - collection of the tasks, roles, scenarios and business
    process created to organize the elements by, for example, line of
    business, business unit or division, or data domain.
  - Business processes – A collection of scenarios to allow a series of
    linked scenarios to be created.
  - Scenarios - A collection of roles that outlines a single process,
    such as creating a new FinishedGood.<span> </span>
  - Roles – A collection of tasks.
  - Tasks - Content WebApp pages designed to collect and validate
    information required to support the business process.

To design a governance hierarchy:

  - [Manage Categories](Manage_Categories)
  - [Manage Business Processes](Manage_Business_Process)
  - [Manage Scenarios](Manage_Scenarios)
  - [Manage Roles](Manage_Roles)
  - [Manage Tasks](Manage_Tasks)

A Designer can evaluate overall business process design and how updates
to a scenario, role or task may affect other elements that are assigned
to that scenario. Refer to these topics for more information:

  - [View the Roles and Tasks Assigned to a
    Scenario](View_the_Roles_and_Tasks_Assigned_to_a_Scenario)
  - [View the Scenarios Where a Role is Used and the Tasks Assigned to
    that Role](View_a_Roles_Scenarios_and_Tasks)
  - [View Scenarios and Roles to which a Task is
    Assigned](View_a_Tasks_Scenarios_and_Roles)
