# Create Dashboards

The Dashboard feature allows users to create custom dashboards that
report data in a graph format. Multiple graphs capturing different types
of data in various graph types can display on a single dashboard. For
example, a dashboard can be configured to display the downloading of
tables as a bar graph and the package types used for downloads as a pie
chart.

**NOTE:** This is a developer’s feature and is not intended for use by
end users. To implement a dashboard into a DSP® component, refer to the
*Dashboard Developer’s Manual* and [Create Dashboards and
Charts](../../WebApp_Dev/Dashboards_and_Charts) for detailed
information.
