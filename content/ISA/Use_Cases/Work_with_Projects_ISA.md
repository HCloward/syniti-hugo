# Work with Projects

Projects are created in IS and brought into ISA via a DSPÂ® component
called Collect. Refer to [Getting Started with the
ISA](Setup_and_Configuration_for_ISA) for information about bringing
projects into ISA upon initial install and when new projects are created
in IS.

A project must have at least one Distribution, but can have multiple
Distributions. Each Distribution has a Distribution Owner, who is the
primary contact of information for the data quality rules configured in
the Distribution.

ISA sends workflow emails about failed data records from the IS rules in
each Distribution to users depending on the WORKFLOW OPTION setting on
the *[Users](../Page_Desc/Users_ISA)* page. Refer to A[dd Rules to a
Project Distribution](Add_Rules_to_a_Project_Distribution) and
[Activate Users in a Project
Distribution](Add_Users_to_a_Project_Distribution) for more
information.
