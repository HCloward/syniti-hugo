    Accounts](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Create_User_Accounts_in_System_Administration.htm)
    (performed by an Administrator).

2.  [Create an ISA Security
    Role](../Use_Cases/Create_an_ISA_Security_Role.htm) (performed by an
    Administrator).

3.  [Assign Users to the ISA Security
    Role](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Assign_Users_to_Security_Roles.htm)

    DSP users with appropriate ISA security. This step should be
    repeated when removing users from ISA security as well.
    
    **NOTE:** The user being added needs to have an email address
    assigned in order to appear as an available user for distribution.
