# SQL AutoGen Overview

SQL AutoGen creates basic objects used by the migration process (tables,
rules and reports) so that users can focus on addressing complex
requirements.

All objects created using SQL AutoGen are written to the data source
defined for the object in Console (Process Area \> Objects \> Vertical
View \> Data Source ID).

Access SQL AutoGen by clicking the gold Automation tab in the Quick
Panel.

## Setup and Configuration for SQL AutoGen

Before using SQL AutoGen:

  - [Create the Contexts for Migration
    Projects](../Console/Use_Cases/Create_Contexts_for_Migration_Projects.htm)
  - Use Target Design to create a target. Refer to [Target
    Design](../Design/Design_Overview.htm) for more information.

**NOTE:** The target and source tables can be generated after the target
has been designed.

If rules are to be generated:

  - [Add Basic Rules in Target
    Design](../Design/Use_Cases/Basic_Rules.htm)
  - [Sync Map and Target
    Design](../Design/Use_Cases/Sync_Map_and_Target_Design_TD.htm)
  - [Perform Field Mapping](../Map/Use_Cases/Perform_Field_Mapping.htm)
