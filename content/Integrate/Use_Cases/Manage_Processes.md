# Manage Processes

Regardless of the template type a process is based on, many functions
around creating and configuring processes are the same.

These include:

  - [Create a Process](Create_a_Process.htm)

  - [Copy a Process](Copy_a_Process.htm)

  - [Add Templates to a Process](Add_Templates_to_a_Process.htm)

  - [Copy a Process Template](Copy_a_Process_Template.htm)

  - [Generate Database Objects
    Automatically](Generate_Database_Objects_Automatically.htm)
