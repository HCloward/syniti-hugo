# Monitor Table Download Process

The table download process can be monitored to see which individual
tasks have completed for the download.

**NOTE**:Â To receive a workflow email that a table download has failed
in Collect, a user must be assigned to a security role that has the
Collect WebApp group WorkFlowFailureAll or WorkFlowFaiureByTargetAccess
assigned. Refer to [Set
Security](../../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Setting_security.htm) in System
Administration for more information.
