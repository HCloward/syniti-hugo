# Edit the Priority and Publish Setting

A Target is added and configured in Target Design, but a Target's
priority can be edited in Transform. The priority is the order the
Target is processed.Â 

A user can also select the PUBLISH check box to allow all Target and
Source reports in the Target to display for Business Users assigned to
the reports.

To edit these settings in Transform:

1.  Click the **Targets** icon on the *[Process Area
    Launch](../Page_Desc/Process_Area_Launch.htm)* page.

2.  Click **Edit** for a TARGET.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Targets
    page](../Page_Desc/Targets_H.htm)*

3.  Enter a value in the **PRIORITY** field.

4.  Click to check or uncheck the **PUBLISH** check box as needed.

5.  Click **Save**.
