# Access Scorecards

A user can access scorecards in IS for a project or for a project
distribution. Other scorecards in IS can be linked to project
distributions, though setting scorecards at the project distribution
level is optional.

At the project level, when a user clicks the scorecard link in a
workflow email or on the [Project Summary page’s Vertical
View](../Page_Desc/Project_Summary_H#Project_Summary_V), a general
scorecard displays.

At the project distribution level, when a user clicks the scorecard link
in a workflow email or on the [Project Distributions page’s Vertical
View](../Page_Desc/Project_Distributions_H#_Project_Distributions_V),
a scorecard for that project distribution displays.

If a scorecard link is set at the project distribution level, a user in
the project distribution receives a link to this scorecard in workflow
emails. If no scorecard link is set at the project distribution level, a
user receives a link to the project scorecard link.
