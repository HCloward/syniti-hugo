# Daily Summary By Wave & Process Area

This chart displays the number of mappings per status for all field
mappings in the Wave and Process Area in the Context bar for the day.

The Total Mappings is the count of active fields in the Target.

Hover a cursor over a section of a chart to view the count of mappings
for that status.

Click the line for a Wave and Process Area to drill down to the
*[Objects](../Page_Desc/Objects_map.htm)* page to view the Objects that
are in the context. From here, drill down to other dashboards that
display field mapping summaries at the Object and Target level by
clicking Metrics for an Object.

Refer to [Daily Summary By Object](Daily_Summary_by_Object.htm) for more
