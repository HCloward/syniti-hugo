# View Controls and Control Formats

A system administrator can view the controls and the associated formats.
The controls and formats are shipped with the platform. Controls are

page configuration. Refer to [Add a Control Type to a
Column](Add%20a%20Control%20Type%20to%20a%20Column.htm) for more
information.

    *Navigation* pane.
