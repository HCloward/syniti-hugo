# View a User’s Authentications, Property Changes and Access Changes

An Administrator can view the system logs for a user, which detail:

  - **Authentications** — The connections that used this user’s ID
    (success and failures)
  - **Property Changes** — Changes the user made to properties, such as
    password changes
  - **Access Changes** — Changes the user made to security settings,
    such as assignment of security definitions

To access the logs:

1.  Select **Admin \> Security \> Users** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click **Vertical View** for a user.
3.  Click the **View History** icon.
