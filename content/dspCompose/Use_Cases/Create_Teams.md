# Create Teams

To make templates easier to manage, dspCompose™ organizes templates by
teams, and all templates belong to a team. At least one team must exist
before a template can be created.

Users must be added to dspCompose to be added to a team. Refer to [Add
Users to dspCompose™](../Config/Add_Users_to_dspCompose.htm) for more
information.

To create a team:

1.  Select **Team** on the *Navigation* pane.
    
    **NOTE:** Users can view all dspCompose™ teams, even if they do not
    have access to any templates in the team. If the **Templates** icon
    on the *Team* page displays a count of 0, the user does not have
    access to any templates for that team.

2.  Click **Add**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Team
    page.](../Page_Desc/Team.htm)*

3.  Enter a name in **TEAM NAME** field.

4.  Click **Save**.
