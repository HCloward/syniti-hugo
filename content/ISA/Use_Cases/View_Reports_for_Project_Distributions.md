# View Reports for Project Distributions

View the most recent version of reports for all projects by project
distribution. Â 

**NOTE**: The ISA only stores the most recent version of a report. A
report is retained based on the value entered in the Days to Retain
History field on the *[Parameters](../Page_Desc/ISA_Parameters)*
page. After the retention interval is passed, the report is deleted.
