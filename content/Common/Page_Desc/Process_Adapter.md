<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Field</p></td>
<td><p>Description</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>PROCESS NAME</p></td>
<td><p>Displays the name of the external process being accessed via the Process Queue. The names are derived from the name of the Data Services entry in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Source Registry</span> page (the Name column from the ttDataSourceRegistry table in the DSPCommon database) with a prefix based on the operation the processes Â perform. This is necessary to create separate queues for each Data Services instance that is registered. The names for Execute and Polling processes have the following naming convention:</p>
<ul>
<li>JobExecute_&lt;Data Source Registry Name&gt;</li>
<li>JobPolling_&lt;Data Source Registry Name&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>The entries with the prefix of 'JobExecute_' and 'JobPolling_' are used to make the calls to Data Services to execute and wait for a job to complete.</p>
<p>These processes can have different properties set on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Process Adapters Properties</span> page as they are different types of processes that are being called.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>MAX INSTANCE COUNT</p></td>
<td><p>Displays the maximum number of calls that can be made simultaneously for all users for the given process. This would either be active calls to a Data Services instance or Job Imports to a Data Services instance.</p>
<p>This value cannot be less than 1.</p></td>
