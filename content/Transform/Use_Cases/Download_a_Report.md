# Download a Report

Files with more than 50K records are downloaded as .txt files.

Files with less than 50K records are downloaded as .xlsx files.

To download a report on the Report Delivery page in Transform:

1.  Select **My Reports \> All Reports** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **All Reports** icon.

3.  Click the **Download a file** icon for the desired report.
    
    **NOTE:** The Wave, Process Area and object are added to the folder
    path of the Report Delivery reports to prevent two working Waves
    from overlaying the same file.  
    For example, if ttMara was in two Waves, the filenames would be
    C:\\DSP\\Transform\\Reports\\Wave1\\MM\\MaterialMaster\\ttMara\_PreLoad.xls
    and
    C:\\DSP\\Transform\\Reports\\Wave2\\MM\\MaterialMaster\\ttMara\_PreLoad.xls

4.  Follow the browser specific instructions that are presented.
