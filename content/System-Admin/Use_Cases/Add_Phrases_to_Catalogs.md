# Add Phrases to Catalogs at the WebApp and Page Level

An Administrator can add translations for phrases in a corresponding
language. That phrase translation displays in column headings of
*Horizontal*, *Vertical* and Filter views.

A user can also set an option to [Display Translations for Column
Data](Display_Translations_for_Column_Data.htm).

Adding a phrase translation at the WebApp level instructs the platform
to display the phrase translation on every applicable page within the
WebApp to which the catalog is assigned.

Adding a phrase at the page level displays the translation on that page
only.

**NOTE:** Phrases cannot be added to any catalog with the Read Only
check box checked on the
[Catalogs](../Page_Desc/Catalogs_H.htm#Catalogs_V) pageâ€™s *Vertical*
View.

**NOTE:** Refer to [Manage WebApp Catalogs](Manage_Catalogs.htm) for
general information.

To view all phrases and their translations in all catalogs, select
**Admin \> Translations \> Phrases** in the *Navigation* pane.
