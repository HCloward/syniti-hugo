# Extraction Methods Overview

This documentation describes data extraction methods used in the
end-to-end integration solution. There is appreciable effort required in
configuring, testing and tuning data extraction methods to achieve
optimal performance. Therefore, there are few hard-and-fast rules as to
when a particular method should be used. The selection of a method is
often determined on a table-by-table basis and may change over time.
This section identifies some of the variables to be considered for
improving the overall performance of data extraction and replication,
the pros and cons of each extraction method and examples of their
usage. 

This content consists of the following sections:

  - [System Considerations](System_Considerations)
