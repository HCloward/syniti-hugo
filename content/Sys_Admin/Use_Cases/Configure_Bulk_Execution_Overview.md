# Configure Bulk Execution

Bulk Execution allows a user to validate all records or a subset of
those records on a DSP® page via a simple, guided user experience.

A Page Designer can enable Bulk Execution on a Construction page or a
page in a custom WebApp. Refer to [Enable Bulk Execution for a
Page](Enable_Bulk_Execution_for_a_Page) for more information.

Some pages in the DSP are [delivered with Bulk Execution
enabled](DSP_Pages_Delivered_with_Bulk_Execution_Enabled).

Bulk Execution can also be run via a public WebApp event. Refer to the
Knowledge Base article on the Support site called [Bulk Execution
Developer
Guide](https://support.boaweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013630187-Bulk-Execution-Developer-Guide)
for more information.

The Bulk Execution process only runs for the records that are accessible
by the user as determined by that user’s security settings.

If a record is read-only, the record is not included in the Bulk
Execution process. When Bulk Execution completes, read-only records
display on the Results tab under the label Record was skipped during
execution.
