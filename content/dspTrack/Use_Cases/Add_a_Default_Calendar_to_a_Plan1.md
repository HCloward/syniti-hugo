# Add a Default Calendar to a Plan or to All Plans

dspTrack™ uses the non-work days and holidays in a calendar when
performing status calculations. Calendars are added in Common, where the
calendar users, holidays and non-work days are also assigned. Refer to
[Use a Calendar](../../Common/Use_Cases/Use_a_Calendar.htm) for more
information.

A calendar can be assigned while importing a project into a plan. Refer
to [Import Project Files into
dspTrack™](Import_Project_Files_into_dspTrack.htm) for more
information.
