# Profile Data Source

Common provides a quick and easy method to perform an assessment of data
contained within a database. The following elements are available for
all profiled databases:

  - A list of all tables in the database
  - A list of all columns within each table with defined Data Type,
    Length and Table Order
  - A frequency distribution of values for each column
  - A minimum and maximum value for each column
  - A number of blank, null or empty values for each column
  - Indication of unused tables and fields

The goal of data profiling is to save hours of research effort by
listing all database information in one location. It is important to
note that data profiling does **<span class="underline">not</span>**
replace viewing and analyzing data, but is considered a value-added
activity for reporting to the client and can provide useful information
at the beginning of a Data Migration project.
