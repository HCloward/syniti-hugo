| OBJECT ID                 | Displays the name of the object whose development is being tracked.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| TARGET ID                 | Displays the name of the target assigned to the object.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| TARGET TYPE               | Displays the target type used to categorize the target. Examples include Configuration or Historical Data. Refer to [Configure Target Types](../Config/Configure_Target_Types.htm) for more information.                                                 |
| ACTUAL COMPLETION RATE    | Displays the actual completion rate for migration for this object, which is the count of completed records in the target. A record is complete when there are no errors associated with it.                                                              |
| TARGET COMPLETION         | Displays the target completion rate for migration for this object based on the object typeâ€™s count estimate. This value is set on the <span style="font-style: italic;">[Object Estimates (Setup)](../Page_Desc/Object_Estimates_Setup.htm)</span> page. |
| PROJECTED COMPLETION RATE | Displays the projected completion rate for migration for this object. The value is the percent of the actual completion rate compared to the target completion count.                                                                                    |
