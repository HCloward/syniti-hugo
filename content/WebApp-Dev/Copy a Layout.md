# Copy a Layout

Several layouts are delivered; however, they cannot be modified as they
are assigned to pages in the DSPÂ®. Users may copy delivered layouts and
modify as needed.

**NOTE**: If a custom layout needs to be modified, it must be unassigned
from the page.

Refer to [Add Layouts](Add%20Layouts.htm) and [Create a
Dashboard](Create_a_Dashboard.htm) for more information.

To copy a layout:

1.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Layouts** in the *Navigation*
    pane.
2.  Click the record for the layout to copy.
3.  Click the **Copy** icon in the Page toolbar.
4.  Click **OK**.
