# Set a Language As Active

Setting a language as active makes it available to use on the *Settings*
panel (accessed by selecting Settings after clicking the Change Settings
icon in the Site toolbar) and therefore allows the user to use it on any
page.

To set a language as active:

1.  Select **Admin \> Translations \> Languages** in the *Navigation*
    pane.
2.  Click the check box next to the desired language(s); the settings
    are automatically saved.
