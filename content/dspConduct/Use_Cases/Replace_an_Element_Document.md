# Replace an Element Document

A Designer has the ability to replace the current file with an updated
version of the file or a completely different file.

Before performing this task:

  - [Create a category](Create_a_Category.htm)

Add one of the following elements depending on which one the user is
working with at the moment:

  - [Add a role](Add_a_Role.htm)
  - [Add a scenario](Add_Scenario.htm)
  - [Add a business process](Add_Business_Process.htm)
  - [Upload an Element
    Document](Upload_and_Download_Element_Documentation.htm)

To replace an element document:

1.  Select <span style="font-weight: bold;">dspConduct</span>**\>
    Design** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click the Roles, Tasks, Scenarios or Business Processes icon for a
    category.
