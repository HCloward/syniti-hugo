# Source Rules (Active) By Target

This chart displays all Source rules with a status of Active for the
Object selected on the Source Rules (Active) By Object chart.

Source rules clean and massage Source data before it is loaded in the
Target table. The final Source rule (the rule with the highest priority)
pushes the data into the Target table from the Source.

Hover a cursor over the bar to view the total count of active Source
rules.

Click a bar for a Target table to open the [Target Source
Rules](../Page_Desc/Target_Source_Rules_H.htm) page to view the Source
rules.

Refer to [View Dashboards in
Transform](View_Dashboards_in_Transform.htm) for general information
