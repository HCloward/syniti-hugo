# Set up dspTrack™ Security for Delivered Security Roles

To set up security for dspTrack™ in System Administration for these
installed (i.e., delivered) template security roles, an Administrator:

1.  Creates User Accounts
2.  Assigns Users to Security Role  

A user can then:

3.  Add Projects and Plans in dspTrack™. Refer to [Organize Plans with
    Projects](../Use_Cases/Organize_Plans_with_Projects.htm) for more
    information.

An Administrator can then:

4.  Assign the security key for the newly created projects and plans to
    the template security role in System Administration.

**NOTE**: An Administrator must assign security keys to a role every
time a new project or plan is created in dspTrack™.
