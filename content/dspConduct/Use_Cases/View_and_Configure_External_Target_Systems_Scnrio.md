# View and Configure External Target Systems for a Scenario

The [Scenario Process Target
Connection](../Page_Desc/Scenario_Process_Target_Connection) page
displays all templates that are registered to a process in Integrate. A
Designer can change the connection value to allow a scenario to post to
a different target system than the one specified at the Integrate
template level. The process must be active in Integrate to be available
in a scenario.

Before completing this task, [Add a Scenario](Add_Scenario) and [Add
a Process to a Scenario](Add_an_Integrate_Process_to_a_Scenario).

This task must be completed in order for requests created from the
scenario to be posted to the correct target system. Refer to [Create a
Process](../../../Platform/Integrate/Use_Cases/Create_a_Process) in
Integrate for more information about processes.

To view and configure external target systems for a scenario in
dspConduct™:

6.  Select a connection from the **Connection ID** list box.
    
    **NOTE:** This connection ID specifies the target system to which
    the Integrate process posts for this specific scenario. The
    connections for a template are defined on the Template page in
    Integrate. Refer to [Create a Basic Template in
    Integrate](../../../Platform/Integrate/Use_Cases/Create_a_Basic_Template)
    for more information.
