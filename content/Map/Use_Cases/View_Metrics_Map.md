# View Metrics

Map captures metrics about mapping progress by target; by month, day or
week; and by object. Other reports that track mapping by defined gate
dates can also be viewed.

To view metrics in Map:

1.  Click **Map** in the Context bar.

2.  Click the **Metrics** icon on the *[Process Area
    Launch](../Page_Desc/Process_Area_Launch_map.htm)* page.

3.  Click the **Metrics Charts** icon to view the Target Summary
    dashboard to view bar charts of completed versus total mappings to
    be completed.
    
    **NOTE:** All Source database Objects must be mapped with an action
    against active Target fields. Refer to [View Dashboards in
    Map](View_Dashboards_in_Map.htm) for more information.

The following are the metric report types:

  - **Metrics** – Click to view Object and Target percentages and sum
    counts about the mapping status.
  - **Gate Field Mapping** – Click to view field mapping Gate Percentage
    and Gate Dates compared to actual mapping progress.  
    Refer to [Set up Wave Gate Metrics for
    Map](../../Console/Use_Cases/Evaluate_Mapping_with_Wave_Gate_Metrics.htm)
    for more information.
  - **Gate Value Mapping** – Click to view value mapping Gate Percentage
    and Gate Dates compared to actual mapping progress. Refer to [Set up
    Wave Gate Metrics for
    Map](../../Console/Use_Cases/Evaluate_Mapping_with_Wave_Gate_Metrics.htm)
    for more information.
  - **Process** – Click to update current Snap Shot counts for daily
    metrics. Weekly and monthly counts only process at the end of the
    week or on the first of each month. <span>Refer to [Capture
    Statistics for Wave Gate
    Metrics](Capture_Statistics_for_Wave_Gate_Metrics.htm) for more
    information.</span>
  - **Rule Book** – Click to view field mapping details for all Objects
    and Targets within the Wave and Process Area for the current
    user.  The report is used for the rule book used in Transform so
    the developer can see the same information that the mapper sees.
