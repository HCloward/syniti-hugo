# Import Archive to the Target Instance

Once exported, the archive is then imported to the target instance.

To import an archive to the target instance:

1.  Log in to the DSP® on the target instance (for example, QA).

2.  Select **Admin \> CTS \> Archives** in the *Navigation* pane.

3.  Click **Detect Archives** on the Page toolbar if the desired archive
    does not appear immediately; a confirmation message displays.

4.  Click **OK**.

5.  Click **Import** for the archive name to import the archive into the
    instance.
    
    **NOTE:** The Import button name changes based on the state of the
    package and the archive. Refer to the following table for
details:
