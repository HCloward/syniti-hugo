# Copy a Security Role

Before this task is performed, the role being copied must exist. Refer
to [Create Security Roles](Create_Security_Roles.htm) for more
information.

An Administrator has the ability to copy an existing role into a new
role. This copy process includes keys, configured quick links and WebApp
groups. It does not include the user(s) assigned to that role.

To copy a role:

1.  Select **Admin \> Security \> Security Definitions \> Security
    Roles** in the Navigation pane; the *Security Roles* page displays.

2.  Select a Security Role.

3.  Click the **Copy Role** icon; the **Copy Role***Vertical* View
    displays.

4.  Click **Edit**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Copy Role
    page](../Page_Desc/Copy_Role.htm)

5.  Enter a description in the **Description** for the new role.

6.  Enter a unique name in the **New Name** field for the new role.

7.  Click **Save**.

8.  Click the **Copy Role** icon.

9.  Click the **Back** arrow.

**NOTE:** Once the Back arrow is clicked, the new role will appear on
the *Security Roles* page.
