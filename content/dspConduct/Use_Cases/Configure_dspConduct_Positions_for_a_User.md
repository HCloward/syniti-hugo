# Configure dspConduct Positions for a User

A Security Administrator can view and configure dspConduct positions to
which a user has access.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: A user must belong to the
Users Manager WebApp Group in dspConduct to configure security for
dspConduct users.

must be assigned to the same calendar in Common. Refer to [Use a
Calendar](../../../Platform/Common/Use_Cases/Use_a_Calendar.htm) for

the roles that have been added to the position, and the role conflicts
established on the *[Role (Conflicts)](../Page_Desc/Role_Conflicts.htm)*
