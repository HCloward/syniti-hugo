# Set User Workflow Receipt Preferences

dspConduct™ sends workflow messages to users who have access to a
request when a request is created, canceled, deleted, finished, rejected
or reset.

Workflow messages can also be sent after a [Final Finish package is
created but fails to
run](Send_Workflow_Notifications_when_a_Final_Finish_Package_Fails.htm),
or [when a post fails or
succeeds](Send_Workflow_Notifications_when_a_Post_Fails_or_Succeeds.htm).

Workflow messages can be received via email, a notification in the DSP®,
or both. By default, users receive workflow messages from dspConduct™
via email.

A user can also set an option to receive no notifications. This is
useful in cases where only one user is working on a particular task and
therefore does not need to receive notifications when events are
completed.

A user can change workflow receipt preferences for that user’s account
on the *[My Settings](../Page_Desc/My_Settings.htm)* page.

An Administrator can set workflow receipt preferences for all
dspConduct™ users.

To view the text of messages installed with dspConduct™, refer to [View
Default Workflow Messages.](View_Default_Workflow_Messages.htm)

To set user preferences:

1.  Select **dspConduct \> Security**, in the *Navigation* pane or, if
    the Security menu is expanded, click **User Settings**.
    
    **NOTE:** If a non-Administrator user accesses the page, the *My
    Settings* page opens displaying only that user’s information. If an
    Administrator accesses the page, the *User Settings* page opens,
    displaying all user accounts that have permission to use
    dspConduct™. The Administrator must select the user record to set
    the preference.

2.  Click an icon in the Page toolbar to set receipt preference.

Alternatively:

1.  Select **dspConduct \> Security** in the *Navigation* pane or, if
    the Security menu is expanded, click **User Settings**.
    
    **NOTE:** If a non-Administrator user accesses the page, the *My
    Settings* page will launch with only that user’s information
    available. If an Administrator accesses the page, the *User
    Settings* page will launch, displaying all user accounts that have
    permission to use dspConduct™. The Administrator must select the
    user record to set the preference.
