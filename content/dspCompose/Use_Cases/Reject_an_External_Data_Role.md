# Reject an External Data Role

If the Review role rejects the request, the Reviewer enters a reason for
the rejection. dspCompose™ sends an email with the spreadsheet attached
to the External Data role for correction. This spreadsheet contains the
rejection reason in the Rejection Reason column and the original request
data.

If a request initiated by an External Data role is posted but includes
invalid data that fails to post in SAP, dspCompose™ automatically resets
the request and sends an email to the user designated as the external
contact for the External Data role. The spreadsheet attached to the
email contains the Post Message column with the error returned from SAP.
