# Assign Group Owner to a Group

Group Owners are assigned by system administrators (i.e., users with
access to the Configuration menu).

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: The Group Owner for a
group is assigned when the group is added. After the group has been
saved, only the Group Owner can assign another owner to the group.

To assign a group owner to a
group:

1\.<span style="font: 7.0pt &#39;Times New Roman&#39;;">   </span> Select
