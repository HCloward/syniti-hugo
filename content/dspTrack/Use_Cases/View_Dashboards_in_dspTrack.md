# View the Dashboard in dspTrack™

The dspTrack™ dashboard provides an overview of the status of projects,
plans, and tasks.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: Charts display data from
active plans only. Refer to [Activate and Deactivate a
Plan](Activate_and_Deactivate_a_Plan) for more information.

**NOTE**: Information about Work List Items is not displayed in the
dashboard as Work List Items are not assigned to projects and plans.

The data on the dashboard displays based on a user’s security settings.
For example, if a user has access to one plan only the data from that
plan is used to populate the dashboard.

The View Data icon to the right of a chart name opens a pane that
displays the alternate text descriptions of chart data in a table.

Hover a cursor over each section of a bar to view the field count.

If a chart is 3D, a 3D Controls icon is available to adjust the chart
angles.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: Click a label in a chart’s
legend to hide or show that label’s section in the chart.

The following charts display on the dashboard:

  - [Tasks Due Next Week By
    Project](../Page_Desc/Tasks_Due_Next_Week_By_Project)
  - [Tasks Status by Project](../Page_Desc/Task_Status_By_Project)
  - [Task Status by Plan](../Page_Desc/Task_Status_by_Plan)
