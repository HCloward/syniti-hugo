# Data Services AutoGen Overview

Data Services AutoGen is driven by Target Design in dspMigrate™. Data
Services AutoGen provides the ability to generate Data Services Jobs
that perform target enrichments and validations, including post load
validation of the data loaded into the target application.

Using the AutoGen request options in the DSP®, users send the metadata
required to generate the Data Services Jobs for the specific target to
the dspCloud™ for processing. Data Services Jobs are created based on
Target Design. Once generated, the Jobs are registered in Transform as
Data Services rules.

As the Jobs created in Data Services are based on the design of the
target system and the rules applicable to it, the Jobs can be reused
across multiple migration Waves and also post go live for data
governance purposes for interfaces, data transfers or further migrations
(acquisitions / mergers).
