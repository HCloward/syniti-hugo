# Disable and Enable Logging for Pages

A System Administrator can disable logging for specific pages if the
data on these pages is not related to personal data or does not need to
be tracked.

To disable logging by page:

1.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Parameters** on the *Navigation*
    pane.
2.  Click the **Logging Options** tab.
3.  Click the **Enable Logging By Page** icon.
4.  Select a page or multiple pages.
5.  Click the **Disable Page** icon.

**NOTE:** To enable logging on a page that has had logging disabled,
click the **Enable Page** icon.

**NOTE:** The daily log also tracks when logging is enabled or disabled
for a page and by whom.
