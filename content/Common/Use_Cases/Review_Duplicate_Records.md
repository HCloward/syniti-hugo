# Review Duplicate Records

Review duplicate records to decide if the record is a true duplicate, if
the record must be reset or if the record is not a duplicate.

To review duplicate records:

1.  From the *[Results](../Page_Desc/Results.htm)* page, click
    **Duplicates**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Duplicates
    page](../Page_Desc/Duplicates.htm)*

2.  Review the duplicate record pairs. Options are:
    
      - Leave the record pair as is if the Obsolete Object and Actual
        Object are duplicates.
      - Click **Reset** to reset the record pair as an unresolved
        candidate so it can be reanalyzed. This action removes the
        record pair from the *Results* page. If that record pair is in
        the current set of source data, it re-appears on the
        *Candidates* page.
      - Click **Mark As Non Duplicate** to mark the Obsolete Object and
        Actual Object as non-duplicate records.
