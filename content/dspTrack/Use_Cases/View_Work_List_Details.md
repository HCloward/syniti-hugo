# View Work List Details

The *Work List Detail* page displays additional information that is not
available on the Work List about all tasks in every task status,
including Completed.

To view the work list details:

1.  Click the blue tab on the Quick Panel to access the Work List.
2.  Click **Work List Details** on the Page Toolbar; all work list
    details for all Plan Tasks and Work List Items display.

**NOTE:** If no items display on the Work List, the Work List Details
icon is disabled.

**NOTE:** The *Work List Detail* page displays behind the Work List and,
depending on how the user’s view is configured, may be obstructed by the
Work List itself. In this case, to view the *Work List Detail* page,
either close the Work List or reduce the size of the Work List pane.
