# View Workflow Download Failures

Collect can send workflow emails to notify users when a table download
fails. To configure users to receive this email, an Administrator must
add users to a security role in System Administration. This security
role must have access to the WebApp group WorkFlowFailureAll or
WorkFlowFaiureByTargetAccess. Refer to the Set Security section of
System Administration for more information.

To view workflow emails for table download failures, select
**Administrative \> Workflow Download Failures** in the *Navigation*
pane.

**NOTE:**Â To receive a workflow email that a table download has failed
in Collect, a user must be assigned to a security role that has the
Collect WebApp group WorkFlowFailureAll or WorkFlowFaiureByTargetAccess
assigned. Refer to [Set
Security](../../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Setting_security.htm) in System
Administration for more information.
