# SLA Percent On Time by Business Process

When a request is submitted, a due date for each of the request’s roles
is calculated based on the Work Days, Hours and Minutes SLA settings for
the role. As request roles are finished, new due dates are calculated
for subsequent roles whose dependencies are complete. When charts are
produced, these due dates are used to determine the percent on time
values for the specific design element (i.e., category, business
process, scenario, or role) being viewed.

When accessed from the *[Category](Category_H.htm)* page’s *Vertical*
View, this chart displays the on time percentages of business processes
in a category according to established SLA settings based on active
requests. When accessed from the *[Business
Process](Business_Process_H.htm)* page’s *Vertical* View, this chart
displays the on time percentage for the selected business process.
