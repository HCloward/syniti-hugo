# Set the Upload Path for dspTrack™

dspTrack™ allows users to import project files in MSProject (.mpp) and
Excel file (.xlsx) format to use when creating or updating a plan. A
project file must be uploaded before it can be imported.

The file path where project files are uploaded must be set at a client’s
site prior to creating plans.

To set the upload path:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Parameters** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Edit**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Parameters page’s Validations
    tab](../Page_Desc/Parameters_dspTrack.htm#Validations_Tab)

3.  Enter the path where project files should be uploaded in the Plan
    Upload File Path field.

**NOTE**: Include the drive in the path i.e., C:\\Program Files
(x86)\\BOA\\Track\\Uploads\\

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: The process requires full
access to this location or an 'access denied' error message displays
when a user tries to upload a plan. To resolve this, a site
Administrator must set the required permissions for this location.
