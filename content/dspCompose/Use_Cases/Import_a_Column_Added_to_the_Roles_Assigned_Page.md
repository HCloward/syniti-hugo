# Import a Column Added to the Roleâ€™s Assigned Page

If a column is added to the platform page assigned to a template role,
the Template Administrator can import that column to include it in the
dspCompose-generated Excel file.

A column is imported once. If its configuration changes, the column must
be deleted from the page and imported again.

**NOTE**: The existing column configuration is not overwritten by this
process.

**NOTE**: If columns are removed from the platform page assigned to the
template role, the columns must be manually removed on the *[Template
(Role Excel Column
Control)](../Page_Desc/Template_Role_Excel_Column_Control_H.htm)* page.

To import columns:

1.  Click **Team** on *Navigation
    <span style="font-style: normal;">pane</span>*.

2.  Click **Templates** for a team.

3.  Click **Roles** for a template.

4.  Click **Excel Column Control** for a role.
    
    **NOTE:**This icon is not active for the Post role.

5.  Click<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Import Columns</span>.
