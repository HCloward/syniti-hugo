# Troubleshoot Data Download Using a Data Services Job

A Role Processor can troubleshoot issues related to the data download
during the Final Finish process using a Data Services job.

Refer to [Register Tables for Download through Data
Services](Register_Tables_for_Download_through_Data_Services.htm) for
general information.

To troubleshoot Data Services jobs,
select<span style="font-weight: bold;"> dspCompose \> Configuration \>
Data Services Job Executor</span> in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Navigation</span> pane.

On the [Data Services Job
Executor](../Page_Desc/Data_Services_Job_Executor.htm) page, a user can:

  - Click the Execution Logs icon for a job name and request ID to view
    the job status.
  - Click the Execute icon to run the job again.
  - Click the Global Variables icon to enter Global Variables,
    name/value pairs that can be passed into the execution job,
    similarly to how variables are passed into a function. For example,
    if a job must download data for a specific company code, configure
    the Data Services job to take in a global variable called
    "$CompanyCode" with a company code value. Only data pertaining to
    that company codeâ€™s value is passed in to the job and only data for
    that company code is downloaded during the final finish process.
