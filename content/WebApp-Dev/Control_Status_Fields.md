# Control Status Fields

This feature has been deprecated due to the complexity it can add to
views which are laden in control status fields, but in very simple
cases, it can be utilized without bloating the data views. Control
Status field is a field within the pages view (Horizontal, Vertical,
Toolbar, etc.) which acts the same way as a Data Control View.

When used sparingly, it can result in pages that perform well and are
still easy to understand.
