# Customize Dashboard Pages

Dashboard customization allows users to swap out charts and tabular data
within shipped dashboards with any chart or tabular data from any other
application. This functionality is extended to allow for a multi-tiered
setup, which supports site level, role level, and individual user level
configurations to be made by customization administrators.

**NOTE**: The ** [Page
Customization](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Page_Customization.htm) page
displays only those pages in the in the WebApp that allow customization.
If no pages display on the *Page Customization* page, no pages are
available for customization in that WebApp.

There are three ways to assign page customization:

  - [Default (All
    Users)](../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Customize_the_Page_to_Display_for_All_Users.htm)

  - [By
    Role](../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Customize_Pg_Display_Members_Security_Role.htm)

  - [By
    User](../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Customize_Page_Display_Individual_Users.htm)

A user can also [Review Dashboard Customization Settings For a
User](Review%20Dashboard%20Customization%20Settings%20For%20a%20User.htm).
