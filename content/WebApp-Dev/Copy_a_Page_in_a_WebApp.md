# Copy a Page in a WebApp

Instead of designing a page, a user can create a page based on a copy of
an existing page in a WebApp. It can have a different name and can be
placed in the same WebApp or another WebApp. The entire page and all
dependents, such as Column Properties, Events, Validations, Business
Rules and/or WebApp Security Groups can be copied.

Refer to [Page Design Overview](Page%20Design%20Guidelines.htm) for
general information.

**NOTE:** To copy Validation and/or Business Rules, Events **must** also
be copied.

**NOTE:** The *[Copied
Pages](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Copied%20Pages.htm)* page lists all DSP®
pages that have been copied and the pages upon which they were based.

To copy a page:

1.  Access the WebApp page.

2.  Click the **Change Settings** icon on the Site toolbar.

3.  Select **Design**.

4.  Click **Vertical View** for the page.

5.  Click the **Advanced Properties** tab.

6.  Click **Copy**.

7.  Click **Edit**.

8.  Enter a description in the **Target Description** field.

9.  Verify the **Target WebApp ID** is correct.

10. Select which items to copy for the page.

11. Click **Save**.

12. Click **Copy**, again.
    
    **NOTE:** The **Copy** button must be clicked again to officially
    copy the page. The new page displays on the *Pages* page.
