    pane.

    APP NAME</span>.

    [View the field descriptions for the WebApp (Users)
    page](../Page_Desc/WebApp_Users.htm)

4.  Select the user from **USER ID** list box.

5.  Click **Save**.

6.  Click **Groups** for the User ID.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the WebApp Users (Groups)
    page](../Page_Desc/WebApp_Users_Groups.htm)
    
    **NOTE:** If no Groups are currently assigned to the user for the
    WebApp, the page displays in add mode. Otherwise, click
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span>.

7.  Click **Add**.

8.  Select a group name from **GROUP ID** list box.

9.  Enter the date that the user's access to this WebApp Group expires
    in EXPIRATION DATE field.
    
    **NOTE:**Â The **Expiration Date** allows for temporary security to
    be granted. This feature is useful for interns, temporary employees,
    etc. It is also useful when another employee is filling in for a
    person on vacation. The security automatically expires without an
    Administrator manually changing the security.
