# CTS Overview

The Change and Transport System (CTS) process migrates objects from a
source instance to a target instance of the DSP®. In order to CTS
objects, the user must have access to the CTS menu in System
Administration and the target and source instance must be defined.

A user can build a CTS Package that automatically contains all of the
items required to successfully promote the entirety of a Wave (and all
its dependents) to another environment using the CTS process. Refer to
[Create a CTS Package and Build Archive in Source
Instance](CreatePckgeBuildArcSrceInstance.htm) or more information.

The DSP® can also generate a baseline CTS configuration for custom
WebApps. In this case, the DSP® uses a crawler to locate the object’s
registrations, dependencies and relationships and adds the records to
the appropriate CTS Configuration page. The user then sets the
registrations and shippable items based on the autogenerated data. Refer
to [Set a Baseline CTS Configuration for a Custom
WebApp](Set%20a%20Baseline%20CTS%20Configuration%20for%20a%20Custom%20WebApp.htm)
for more information.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> The maximum archive size
is 4MB by default. The 4MB setting can be changed in IIS.

Each WebApp has a pre-defined set of items that can be moved from a
source instance to a target instance. Refer to the following table for a
list of objects that can be moved between instances via the CTS process
(as in, Shippable
Items):

**NOTE:** A package is the record and configuration created on CTS pages
in the DSP®. An archive is built from a package and is the actual item
moved via the CTS process.

To CTS an object:

1.  [Set up the instances](Set_up_Instances.htm) (for example, DEV and
    QA).
2.  [Create package and build the archive on the source
    instance](CreatePckgeBuildArcSrceInstance.htm) (for example, DEV).
3.  [Export the archive to the target
    instance](Export_CTS_Archive_to_Target_Instance.htm) (for example,
    QA).
4.  [Import the archive.](Import_Archive_on_the_Target_Instance.htm) The
    CTS process installs or updates the appropriate application objects
    from the archive.
5.  [Validate the new objects](Validate_Objects.htm) to ensure all
    functionality is updated correctly.
