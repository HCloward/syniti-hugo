# Add Rules Using Quality Dimensions

When a user creates a rule in IS, it is assigned a Quality Dimension.

Quality Dimension, such as Conformity and Consistency, organize rules
and provide a score that contributes to the scorecard value, which is
used to track progress towards a designated goal.

The ISA displays a project’s quality dimension and a rule can be added
or removed from projects based on the rule’s Quality Dimensions.

To add or remove rules:

1.  Click **Information Steward Accelerator \> Project Summary** in
    the*Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Distributions** for a project.

3.  Click **Quality Dimensions** for a Distribution.

4.  Click **Rule Count** for a Quality Dimension to see all the rules
    currently assigned to the project-Quality Dimension combination.

5.  Click **Add** or **Remove** for a rule to add or remove the rule
    from the project distribution.

**NOTE**: A rule can be added to or removed from a project distribution
as necessary.
