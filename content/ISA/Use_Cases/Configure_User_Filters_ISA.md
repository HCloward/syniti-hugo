# Configure User Filters

Filters are customized at the user level to limit data contained in
rules for all project distributions to which the user is assigned. User
filters apply to
**<span class="underline"><span style="color: #ff0000;">all</span></span>**
rules that include the specified field(s).

User filters can also be set on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Project Distribution
Users](../Page_Desc/Project_Distribution_Users.htm)</span> page for a
specific project distribution.

User filters are AND combined with project distribution filters. When
multiple user and project distribution filters are applied across
different columns, these filters are AND combined. If multiple user and
project distribution filters are applied to the same column, these
filters are OR combined.
