# Use the Add Row Source Override Field with Update Row Sources

The table in the Add Row Source Override field on the [Target
Sources](../Page_Desc/Target_Sources_H_Map.htm) page's
<span style="font-style: italic;">Vertical</span> View is used to update
data in the Add Row Source when rules are processed. The table in the
Add Row Source Override field is the left table in the relationship join
for all Update Row Source Update rows.

Relationships are set up and can be viewed using the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Relationship
Joins](../Page_Desc/Relationship_Joins_H.htm)</span> page. Refer to [Add
Relationship Joins to a Source](Add_Relationship_Joins_to_Source.htm)
for more information.
