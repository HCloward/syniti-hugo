# Set Up Automate Security

Setting up security in Automate is a multi-step process. Users are
granted access to specific pages and tasks based on the WebApp group.

**NOTE:** Automate is formerly known as “InterfaceServer” and some
references to this old name are in System Administration.

1.  Assign the user to the InterfaceServer WebApp. Refer to [Assign
    Users to WebApp
    Groups](../../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Assign_Users_to_WebApp_Groups.htm)
    for more information.
2.  Assign the user to a WebApp group for InterfaceServer. Refer to
    [Assign Users to WebApp
    Groups](../../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Assign_Users_to_WebApp_Groups.htm)
    for more information. Options are:

<!-- end list -->

  - **Interface Developer –** Users can create and update interfaces
  - **PowerUser –** Users can configure logical paths, file operations
    and other settings

**NOTE:** The default User and Power Designer user groups are also
included with Automate. Refer to [WebApp
Groups](../../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/WebApp_Groups.htm) help for more
information.
