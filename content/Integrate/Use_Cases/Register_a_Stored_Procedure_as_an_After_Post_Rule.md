# Register a Stored Procedure as an After Post Rule

When posting data to a target system, a Template Administrator can
register an After Post Rule to a process template. The rule runs after
the process template executes successfully and before the next process
template begins processing (if posting with a multi-template process).

A stored procedure can be run as an After Post rule that may take a
variable of @PostingID GUID. If this property exists, then the PostingID
of the posting passes to the procedure. When a business rule After Post
rule is encountered, Integrate runs the rule and waits for it to
complete before running the next rule.

Before performing this task, a Template Administrator must [create a
category](../Config/Create_Categories), [create a
template](Create_a_Basic_Template), and [create a
process](Create_a_Process). A stored procedure must be written and
stored in a data source accessible to the platform.

Refer to [Register After Post Rules to a Process Template
Overview](Register_After_Post_Rules_to_a_Process_Template_Overview)
for general information.
