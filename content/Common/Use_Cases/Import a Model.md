# Import a Model

The DSPÂ® is delivered with an SAP and JDE model that can be used to
import those System Types.

Before performing this task, if needed, click the Models icon to view
the System Types Model configuration (tables, required fields, etc.).
All System Type Model Tables and Model Views must exist in the target
System Type database. The model tables can be extracted from the target
system using Collect. The Model Views can be autogenerated using Build
Views on the *[System Types
Models](../Page_Desc/System_Types_Models_H.htm)* page. Refer to [Manage
System Types with System Type
Models](Manage_System_Types_with_System_Type_Models.htm) for more
information.

    configuration (tables, required fields, etc.). Then navigate back to
