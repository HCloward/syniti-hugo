# Finish the External Data Role

Once the External Data role has emailed the spreadsheet to dspComposeâ„¢
and the data has passed the validations, the External Data role is
finished, and the next role receives an email that the request is
available.

If the request has no other data entry roles, the Data role is finished
and the request moves to the Review role.

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;font-size: 11pt;">If a
request has multiple Data roles, the next Data role in the workflow is
ready for processing.</span>

An external data role can also be
[rejected](Reject_an_External_Data_Role).
