# Setup and Configuration for dspCompose™

There are several elements of dspCompose™ that can be configured before
executing a mass change process. These steps should only be completed by
a developer or a system administrator and are dependent upon the
client's setup.

Before getting started with dspCompose™, verify the following steps have
been completed:

1.  [Set Up Security for dspCompose™](../Config/Set_Up_Security.htm)
2.  [Configure dspCompose™
    Parameters](../Config/Configure_dspCompose_Parameters.htm)
3.  [Configure Global Roles](../Config/Configure_Global_Roles.htm)
4.  [Assign a Catalog to a Custom WebApp for Use with
    dspCompose™](../Config/Assign_Catalog_Custom_WebApp_for_dspCompose.htm)
5.  [Enable Role Validations](../Config/Enable_Role_Validations.htm)
6.  [Update Validation
    Messages](../Config/Update_Validation_Messages.htm)
7.  [Configure Workflow
    Messages](../Config/Configure_Workflow_Messages.htm)
8.  [Set up Workflow Messages](../Config/Set_up_Workflow_Messages.htm)
9.  [Configure Request
    Statuses](../Config/Configure_Request_Statuses.htm)
10. [Configure Columns to Exclude from Mass
    Change](../Config/Configure_Columns_to_Exclude_from_Mass_Change.htm)
11. [Display Posting Options on
    Requests](../Config/Display_Posting_Options_on_Requests.htm)
12. [Configure Settings for External Data Processing and External
    Request
    Scenarios](../Config/Configure_Settings_for_External_Data_Processing.htm)

When the platform is installed, an Integrate category called
**dspCompose** is created that will act as the repository in Integrate
for all the templates created in dspCompose™.

The category is listed on the *Parameters* page. In dspCompose™, select
**Configuration \> Setup \> Parameters**. The name displays in the
**Integrate Category** field.
