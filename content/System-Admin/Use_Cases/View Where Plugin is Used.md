# View where Plugin is Used within the DSP

When the plugin assembly is registered in the DSP, all plugins within
the assembly are automatically brought into the DSP. Users can view the
pages within the DSP where the plugins are registered as business rules,
validation rules and list data providers (as in, instances where a
plugin is used to determine what is displayed in a list box on a DSP
page).

To view where plugins are used within the DSP:

1.  Select **Admin \> WebApps** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Plugins** icon for the desired WEBAPP NAME.

3.  Click the **Plugins** icon for the desired ASSEMBLY.

4.  Click the **Business Rules** icon to view all pages within the DSP
    where the plugin is registered as a business rule.

    Click the **Validation Rules** icon to view all pages within the DSP
    where the plugin is registered as a validation rule.

    Click the **List Data Providers** icon to view all pages within the
    DSP where the plugin is registered as a list data provider (as in,
    instances where a plugin is used to determine what is displayed in a
    list box on a DSP
page).
