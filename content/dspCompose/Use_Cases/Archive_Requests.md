# Archive Requests

Requests are archived based on retention intervals that are tied to
<span id="dspCompose Request Status" class="popUpLink">\>request
status</span>.

Retention intervals are set at the global level, but can also be
configured for a template. Refer to [Configure Request
Statuses](../Config/Configure_Request_Statuses) and [Configure
Retention Parameters](Configure_Retention_Parameters) for more
information.

Once the retention interval for a requestâ€™s request status has been met,
requests are archived when:

  - A service page runs
  - A user clicks **Archive Requests** on the *Archive Requests* page

**NOTE**: If a request is deleted, it is not archived.

To view all archived requests, select **Reports \> Archived Requests**
on the *Navigation* pane.

To archive requests:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Archives \> Archive Requests** on the
    *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click **Archive Requests**; a confirmation message displays.
3.  Click **OK**.
