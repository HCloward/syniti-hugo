# Generate Element Documents

A Designer can generate a document that contains all the information
associated with these elements:

  - [Generate a Business Process
    Document](#Generate_a_Business_Process_Document)
  - [Generate a Scenario Document](#Generate_a_Scenario_Document)
  - [Generate a Role
Document](#Generate_a_Role_Document)

## <span id="Generate_a_Business_Process_Document"></span>Generate a Business Process Document

A Designer can generate a document that contains all the information
associated with the business process. The information includes but is
not limited to:

  - All custom attributes with their configured values
  - All delivered attributes with their configured values
  - The details of the execution order of the process (i.e. which
    scenarios, roles and tasks are included and their dependencies and
    conflicts.)

This report is needed so that anyone can re-create the business process
within dspConduct™.
