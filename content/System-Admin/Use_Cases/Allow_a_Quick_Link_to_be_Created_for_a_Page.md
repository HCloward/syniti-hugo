# Allow a Quick Link to be Created for a Page

*This step is only required for custom development.*

When creating a quick link by security role, a manager must populate the
Page ID field. The pages available in the Page ID list box are
controlled by the page property *Allow Explicit Quick Link*.

To modify page properties, the developer user must have access to the
WebApps menu in SystemÂ Administration.

To allow a quick link to be created for a page:

1.  Click **Admin \> WebApps** in *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Pages** for the WebApp that contains the page to be
    specified as a quick link.

3.  Click **Vertical View** for the page.

4.  Click **Advanced Properties** tab.

5.  Click **Allow Explicit Quick Link** check box to enable it, allowing
    a user to create a quick link for the page.
    
    **NOTE**: Enabling Allow Explicit Quick Link displays the page name
    in the Page ID list box on the *Quick Links* page when creating a
    quick link for a security role or a user.
