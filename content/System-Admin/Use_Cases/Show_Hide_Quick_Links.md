# Hide/Show Quick Links

Quick links can be easily hidden or displayed on the *Quick Links* page.
Hiding a quick link may be useful if it was created for a user by a
manager and the user does not need or want the quick link. (Quick links
created by role or by user cannot be deleted by the recipient.) This
feature also allows a quick link to be saved without having to delete it
and recreate it at another time.

To hide or show a quick link:

1.  Click **Quick Links** icon on Site toolbar.

2.  Click **Manage Quick Links**.

3.  Click **Visibility** button to hide or show the quick link on the
    *Quick Links* page. If the link is hidden, the button displays as
    “Unhide.” If the link is not hidden, the button displays as
    “Hide.”
    
    **NOTE**: If any links are defined, the Quick Links icon always
    displays and the option to hide the icon (i.e., disable Show Quick
    Links) will not be available.
