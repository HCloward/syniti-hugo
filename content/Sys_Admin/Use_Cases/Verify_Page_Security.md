# Verify Page Security

In order for a user to create a quick link for their user profile or for
a manager to create a quick link for a security role or another user,
the recipient of the quick link must have access to the linked page.
Verify page security has been granted before creating a quick link. If
the recipient of the quick link can navigate to the page, a quick link
can be created for the page. If the recipient of the quick link cannot
navigate to the page, security must be granted. Refer to [Assign Users
to WebApp Groups](Assign_Users_to_WebApp_Groups.htm) for detailed
information or contact a site Administrator for assistance.
