# Find Duplicates

Once the duplicates view has been registered and the columns for the
*[Results](../Page_Desc/Results.htm)* page are configured, duplicates
can be found.

To find duplicates:

1.  Click **Analyze** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Duplicates** for Data Source ID.

3.  Click **Build** for Object; a confirmation message displays.

4.  Click **Ok**.
    
    **NOTE:**Â The build process searches the Data Source for potential
    duplicates. Only one object can be built at a time.

5.  Click **Results** on Page toolbar to view duplicate candidates.
