# Acknowledge Failed Jobs

If there are failed jobs on the site, the Services icon on the Site
toolbar is yellow. After the issue that caused the failure has been
corrected, a user can acknowledge the failed job(s) to indicate that the
issue has been debugged and fixed, and there is no longer a need to keep
the failed record. Once all failed jobs on the site have been
acknowledged, the Services icon turns from yellow to green.

There are two methods to acknowledge failed jobs:

• Acknowledge a single failed job on the *[Jobs
(Failed](../Page_Desc/Jobs_Failed_H.htm)*) page

• Acknowledge all failed jobs for a service queue on the *Queues
(Monitor)* page

**NOTE**: Use this method when a large number of jobs must be
acknowledged.

To acknowledge a single failed job:

1.  Click the yellow Services icon on the Site toolbar.

2.  Click **Acknowledge** for a Job ID; the failed job record is removed
    from the *Jobs (Failed)* page.

To acknowledge all failed jobs in a service queue:

1.  Select **Admin \> Resources \> Queues** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Acknowledge Failures** button for the queue.
