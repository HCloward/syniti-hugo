# View All Mappings for a Target

The Target Source Rule Book displays field mapping details for all
Objects and Targets within the Wave and Process Area ID for the current
user.

The report is used for the rule book used in Transform so the developer
can see the same information as the Mapper in Map. To access the report
in Transform, navigate to **Targets \> Reports**.

To view the Rule Book in Map:

1.  Click **Map** in the Context bar.

2.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Metrics</span> icon on
    the *[Process Area
    Launch](../Page_Desc/Process_Area_Launch_map.htm)* page.

3.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rule Book</span> icon on
    the *[Metrics and Reports
    Landing](../Page_Desc/Metrics_and_Reports_Landing.htm)* page.
