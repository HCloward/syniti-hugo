# View a User’s Assigned Security Definitions

A user has access to the data associated with a security definition’s
keys either through a security role assignment or through a user
specific security definition. Refer to [Assign Keys to Security
Role](Assign_Keys_to_Security_Role.htm) and [Establish User-specific
security definitions](Establish_UserSpecific_Security_Definitions.htm)
for more information.

The *[User Security Definition
Summary](../Page_Desc/User_Security_Definition_Summary.htm)* page
displays the security definitions and keys to which a user is assigned.

To view the user’s security definition summary:

1.  Select **Admin \> Security \> Users** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click the **Security Definitions** icon.
