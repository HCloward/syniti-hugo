# Monitor File Operations

File Operations are a configuration setting required for the
FileIterator event, which copies files from a source folder to a target
folder, then deletes the files from the source folder. Once the
FIleIterator event has been submitted, monitor the event via the
*[Monitor I/O Operations](Monitor_I_O_Operations.htm)* page to see the
results that have either failed or are processing.

To monitor file operations:

1.  Select **IO Config \> File Operations** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click **Vertical View** for the desired **OPERATION**.
3.  Click the **Monitor** icon.
