# Copy Projects, Plans, Tasks, and Tags

dspTrack™ objects (p[rojects](Copy_Projects.htm),
[plans](Copy_Plans.htm), [tasks](Copy_Tasks1.htm) and
[tags](Copy_Tags.htm)) can be copied and used as the basis for new
objects.

Depending on the object selected, the user can also copy:

  - Users assigned to the tasks
  - Task dependencies
  - Tags assigned to tasks
  - Work List Event rules for plans
  - Work List Event rules for tasks
  - Work List Event validations for plans
  - Work List Event validations for tasks

**NOTE**: Files uploaded to plans or Plan Tasks are not copied.

**NOTE**: Work List Items, entered on the *Work List Setup* page, cannot
be copied.

The user can also enter a suffix to append to all copied task names, and
can enter a name for the copied object. If no name is entered, dspTrack™
uses \[original object’s name\](Copy).

Additional information should be configured depending on the object
being copied.
