# Trace Object Summary

This chart displays the count for object types contained in the data
source selected on the [Analyze](../Page_Desc/Analyze) page.

**NOTE:** This chart only displays data for object types that exist in
the data source. If, for example, the data source does not have stored
procedures that object type does not display on the chart.

Click the bar for an object type to open the *[SQL
Objects](../Page_Desc/SQL_Objects)* page that displays a list of all
objects of the selected object type in the data source.

Summary](View_Trace_Dashboard_Object_Summary) for information about
the type of data that displays on charts.
