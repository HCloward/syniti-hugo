# View Dashboards in dspCompose™

The charts on dashboards in dspCompose™ display summary information
about templates and requests. Charts display data about request summary
status, status of requests by the logged in user, the number of
templates per team, the number of request records per team, and the
average number of days requests are active for a given week.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>**:** With the exception of
the Status User Dashboard which displays data for the current user, the
data displayed on dspCompose™ dashboards is for all teams, templates and
requests. It is not filtered by a user’s permissions to access teams,
templates, or requests.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>**:** Administrators can use
the Customization options in System Administration to configure which
charts appear on the Main Dashboard by individual users or by Security
roles.

**NOTE:** The number of weeks’ worth of data that displays on charts can
be set by selecting **Dashboards \> Dashboard Parameters** in the
*Navigation* pane.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>**:** If a chart has a
legend, click a label in the legend to hide or show that label’s section
in the chart.

The View Data icon to the right of a chart name opens a pane that
displays the alternate

text descriptions of chart data in a table.

Hover a cursor over each section of a bar to view the field count.  

If a chart is 3D, a 3D Controls icon is available to adjust the chart
angles.
