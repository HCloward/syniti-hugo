# Trace Data Sources

Tracing a data source allows for changes to be captured. This process is
helpful so that the rate of change of a project and of a data source can
be tracked.  It also provides a detailed history of all actions taken on
the design of objects in a database.

This use case covers the following topics:

  - [Configure Trace Parameters](Configure_Trace_Parameters)
  - [Activate and Deactivate Data
    Source](Activate_and_Deactivate_Data_Source)
  - [View
    Objects](../../../Migration/Construct/Use_Cases/View_Objects)
  - [View Object
    Charts](../../../Migration/Construct/Use_Cases/View_Object_Charts)
  - [View Object
    History](../../../Migration/Construct/Use_Cases/View_Object_History)
  - [Download Rate of Change
    Spreadsheet](Download_Rate_of_Change_Spreadsheet)
