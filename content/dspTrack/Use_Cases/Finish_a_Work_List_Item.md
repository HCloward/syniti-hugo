# Finish Work on a Work List Item or Plan Task

A user can mark an item as finished on the <span>Work List</span>, even
if that item is late. Once an item is finished, it no longer displays on
the <span>Work List</span><span>. Plan Tasks in a Completed status
display on the</span>*<span>Plan Task</span>*<span>page and Work List
Detail page. Work List Items in a Completed status display on
the</span>*<span>Work List Detail</span>*<span>page only.</span>

**NOTE**: A user may be required to add a comment to <span> </span>a
Plan Task or Work List Item <span> </span>that is late to finish it.
Refer to [Set Comment Requirements for
Tasks](Set_Comment_Requirements_for_Tasks.htm) for more information.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Work on a task cannot
finish if the task is in a status of Waiting on Dependency. In this
case, if a user clicks Next Action on the Work List, the task(s) and
dependency/dependencies preventing the task from finishing display. Work
List Items cannot have dependencies, so will never be in the Waiting on
Dependency status.
