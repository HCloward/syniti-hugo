# Capture Statistics for Wave Gate Metrics

A gate, with a gate date and a percentage complete, allows a user to
evaluate the current mapping status against a customizable goal.

Map’s Snap Shot process captures mapping statistics at a specific point
in time to measure against Gate Wave metrics for field mapping and value
mapping.

A service page also runs once daily to capture mapping statistics, but a
user can run the process at any time.

Wave Gate metrics are set up in Console. Refer to [Set Up Wave Gate
Metrics for
Map](../../Console/Use_Cases/Evaluate_Mapping_with_Wave_Gate_Metrics.htm)
for more information.

To use Wave Gate metrics:

1.  Enter the GATE NAME, the GATE DATE and the GATE PERCENTAGE for value
    mapping and field mapping in Console.

2.  Run the Snap Shot process in Map to gather current mapping status
    (instructions below).

3.  View the current mapping status in relation to the gate metrics on
    the *[Wave Gate Metrics (Value
    Mapping)](../Page_Desc/Wave_Gate_Metrics_Value_Mapping_H.htm)* page
    and the *[Wave Gate Metrics (Field
    Mapping)](../Page_Desc/Wave_Proc_Area_Gate_Metrics_Field_Mapping.htm)*
    page.
    
    **NOTE:** These pages can be viewed in Map by clicking Metrics on
    the *[Process Area
    Launch](../Page_Desc/Process_Area_Launch_map.htm)* page. Click Gate
    Value Metrics or Gate Field Metrics. These pages open as display
    only when accessed in Map. Wave Gate metrics can only be edited in
    Console.

To run the Snap Shot process in Map:

1.  Click **Map** in the Context bar.
2.  Click the **Metrics** icon on the *Process Area Launch* page.
3.  Click the **Process** icon; a confirmation message displays.
4.  Click **OK**.

To view Wave Gate metrics for the last time the Snap Shot process ran,
click Gate Field Mapping or Gate Value Mapping on the *[Metrics and
Reports Landing](../Page_Desc/Metrics_and_Reports_Landing.htm)* page.

To view daily, weekly and monthly reports with Snap Shot statistics,
click Metrics on the *Metrics and Reports Landing* page.

**NOTE:** The data on these reports is captured when a service page runs
daily to update the gate percentage or when a user runs the Snap Shot
process.
