# Troubleshoot Translations

If translations have been added to a catalog, but they are not
displaying:

  - Try clearing the cache on the
    *[Parameters](../Page_Desc/Parameters_All_TabsSysAdmin.htm)* page.
  - Ensure that the problem phrase does not have an incorrect
    translation stored in a catalog with a more important priority.
  - If a phrase has been entered manually (as in, typed into the
    catalog) confirm it was entered correctly. Check for a leading or
    trailing space, or a misplaced comma or period.
