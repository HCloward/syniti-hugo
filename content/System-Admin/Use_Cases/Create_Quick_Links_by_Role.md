# Create Quick Links by Role

A user, typically a manager, can create a quick link for a specific
security role. This process pushes the quick link to all users assigned
to the security role, giving them access to the link under the Quick
Links icon when they log in. Users assigned to the security role can
then hide or modify the quick link that was created for them as needed,
but cannot delete it. Any changes to the quick link, such as the label,
priority, image, etc. do not impact the quick link for other users
assigned to the security role.

There are a few reasons a manager would create a quick link for a role:

  - Allow users who do not have security to create a quick link to
    receive a quick link

  - Make users aware that the quick link was created

To create a quick link by role:

1.  Select **Admin \> Customization \> Site Customization** in the
    *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **By Role**.

3.  Click **Quick Links** for the security role name.
    
    **NOTE**: If a record does not exist, the page displays in Add mode.
    Otherwise, click **Add**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Quick Links
    page](../Page_Desc/Quick_Links_H.htm)

4.  Enter order in which quick link displays on the *Quick Links* page
    in **Priority** field.

5.  Select a page to be saved as a quick link from **PAGE ID** list box.
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: Pages display in this
    list box if the Allows Explicit Quick Link check box is enabled for
    the page. Refer to [Allow a Quick Link to be Created for a
    Page](Allow_a_Quick_Link_to_be_Created_for_a_Page.htm) for more
    information.

6.  Select an image from **IMAGE ID** list box to add an image to the
    Label.
    
    **NOTE**: The Image ID list box is managed under Admin \>
    Configuration \> Style \> Images. Contact a Site Administrator to
    add an image to the list.

7.  Select a group from **GROUP** list box or enter a new group name and
    click **Use this value** to assign the quick link to a group as a
    means to organize links.

8.  Enter a name for the quick link in **LABEL** field.

9.   Click **Save**; the *Vertical* View displays.

10. Click **Save**.
