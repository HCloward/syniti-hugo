# Update the List of Pages Assigned to a Task

A task defines a unit of work and is associated with the web page or
group of web pages where the work is performed. A Designer can view all
of a task’s associated pages and additional details on the *[Task
Page](../Page_Desc/Task_Page_H)* page.

These pages are then added to a scenario \> role \> task combination,
and can be viewed on the *[Scenario Role Task
Page](../Page_Desc/Scenario_Role_Task_Page)* page.

If a Designer adds a page to the Content WebApp that is a child of
another page, update the page list for that parent task.

**NOTE**: When the page list is updated, updates are also made to any
scenario role tasks that use the parent task.

To update a parent task’s page list:

1.  Click **dspConduct \> Design** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click the **Tasks** icon for a category.
3.  Click the **Pages** icon for a task.
4.  Click the **Update Page List** icon.

**NOTE**: This icon is disabled if multiple pages are selected. The page
list can be updated for one task at a time.
