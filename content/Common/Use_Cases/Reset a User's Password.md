# Reset a User's Password

A user may occasionally need a password to be reset. An Administrator
sends an email to the user containing a temporary password.

In Common, password maintenance is the user’s responsibility. An
Administrator user sends an email to the user associated with an account
to set or to reset that user’s password. This method is recommended for
use by a Help Desk or Call Center, but can be used by any Administrator
for a more streamlined process.

A user’s password can also be set manually by an Administrator.

**NOTE**: The content for email notifications for password creation and
reset can be modified. Refer to [Modify Text for Password Email
Notifications](Modify_Text_for_Password_Email_Notifications.htm) for
more information.

The password reset email is sent to the selected user stating the
password has been reset with a temporary password.

To reset a user’s password:

1.  Select **Common \> User Management** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Select a user ID.
3.  Click **Vertical View**.
4.  Click the **Resend User Creation Email** icon; a message displays.
5.  Click **OK**.
