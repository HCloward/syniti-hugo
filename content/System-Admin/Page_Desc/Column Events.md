# Column Events

A developer can add an event that triggers at the record level when a
user clicks on a field on the page. In this case, select the column name
in the EVENT list box when adding the event on the *[*Page
Events*](Page_Events_H.htm)* page.

**NOTE**: The EVENT list box displays all of the column names that can
have record-level events added.
