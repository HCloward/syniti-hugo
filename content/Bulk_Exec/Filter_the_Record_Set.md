# Filter the Record Set

**NOTE:** Bulk Execution must be enabled for a Page by a Page Designer.
Refer to [Enable Bulk Execution for a
Page](../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Enable_Bulk_Execution_for_a_Page) for
more information.

Filtering the record set before performing Bulk Execution allows the
user to validate a subset of records versus all records, directing the
user to the records requiring correction.

By default, the number of records that can have Bulk Execution performed
at one time is 100K. Refer to [Set Bulk Execution
Parameters](../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Set_Bulk_Execution_Parameters)
for more information. When no filter is applied, all records on the page
are validated.

To filter the record set before performing Bulk Execution:

1.  Select **Filter** from the page gear menu; the filter page displays.

2.  Enter the filter criteria for the fields.
    
    **NOTE:** Refer to [Use Filters in the
    DSPÂ®](../../Use%20Filters%20in%20the%20DSP) for more
    information.

3.  Click **Ok**.

4.  Select **Bulk Execution** from the page gear menu; a confirmation
    message/warning the user that the current record set is filtered
    displays.

5.  Click **Ok**.
