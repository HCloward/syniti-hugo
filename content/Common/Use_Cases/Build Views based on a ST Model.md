# Build Views based on a System Type Model

Before importing a System Type from a System Type Model, the required
model views must exist in the target System Type’s database.

To automatically build the model views in a System Type’s database:

1.  Select **Configuration \> System Type Models** in the *Navigation*
    pane.

2.  Select the **SYSTEM TYPE MODEL**.

3.  Click **Vertical View**.

4.  Click the **Build Views** icon on the Page toolbar.
    
    [*View the field descriptions for the System Types Model Build Views
    page.*](../Page_Desc/System_Types_Model_Build_Views)

5.  Click **Edit**.

6.  Select a data source from **Build Data Source ID** list box.

7.  Click **Build Views**.

**NOTE:** All System Type Model Tables for selected Model must exist in
the target database. These tables should be extracted from the target
system using Collect before executing Build Views. Refer to [Add a
System Type Model Table](Add_a_New_System_Type_Model_Table) for more
information.
