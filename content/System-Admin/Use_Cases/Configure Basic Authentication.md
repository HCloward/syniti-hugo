# Configure Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is the default configuration for the DSP®, no
additional configuration is required. The user must enter a valid DSP®
user ID and password to log in and access a WebApp. An Administrator
must grant the user permissions to WebApps and pages. Refer to [Set
Security](Setting_security.htm) for more information.

Basic Authentication does not maintain any relationship with the
corporate Windows domain or any external authentication provider.

The Basic Authentication check box can be updated on the
[Parameters](../Page_Desc/Parameters_All_TabsSysAdmin.htm) page’s
*Vertical* View on the Security Settings tab.

**NOTE**: Support Basic Authentication dictates the display of the Login
page. Do not disable the Support Basic Authentication check box unless
configuration of Integrated Authentication is complete.
