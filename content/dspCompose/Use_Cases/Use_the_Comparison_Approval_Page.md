# Use the Comparison Approval Page

Before performing this task:

  - [Configure the Comparison Approval
    Setting](Configure_the_Comparison_Approval_Setting)
  - [Register the CompareIns Stored
    Procedure](Register_the_CompareIns_Stored_Procedure)
  - [Create a Request for Comparison
    Approval](Create_a_Request_for_Comparison_Approval)

The Comparison Approval functionality allows the Review role user to see
both the current SAP field value as well as the value the field will be
changed to during the review process.

To view the comparison:

1.  Select **Request** from *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click **Roles** for the request that uses Comparison Approvals.
3.  Click **Data Entry** for the Review Role.

**NOTE:** The data elements that were changed display. The original
value is first next to a green arrow and the changed value displays
after the arrow.

The Review role can reject a change by clicking the REJECT check box to
enable it for the record, or edit data by clicking **Edit**, making an
update and then clicking **Save**.

After Comparison Approval is complete, the request can be processed like
any other request. Refer to [Review Request
Data](Review_Request_Data), [Correct Rejected
Records](Correct_Rejected_Records) and [Post Request Data to the
Target ERP System](Post_Request_Data_to_a_Target_ERP_System) for
more information.
