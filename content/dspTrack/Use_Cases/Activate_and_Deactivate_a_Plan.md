# Activate and Deactivate a Plan

Activate a plan to start scheduling its tasks, and so that users
assigned to tasks can begin work on them using the Work List.

When a plan is created it is inactive by default. A user can add users,
validations, rules and tags to the tasks in the plan. A user can also
import a project file into a plan. However, the plan’s tasks will not
appear on the Work List until the plan is activated.

When a plan is activated:

  - The tasks associated with that plan (that are not in a Completed
    status) display on the Work List
  - Users who have workflow configured on the Workflow User Preference
    page (Configuration \> Workflow \> User Preference) and are assigned
    to tasks in the plan receive a message that the plan is active
  - The first start date for a task (when a user clicks the Next Action
    button on the Work List to move the task from Ready to In Progress
    status) becomes the actual start date for the plan
  - Any updates to tasks while the plan is active are reflected on the
    Work List when the update is saved

When a plan is deactivated:

  - Its tasks are removed from the Work List
  - Users with Workflow configured that are assigned to tasks in the
    Plan receive an email message that the plan is no longer active

To activate a plan:

1.  Select **Project** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click **Plans** for a project.
3.  Click **Vertical View** for a plan.  
    OR  
    Click **Tasks** for a plan and click **Vertical View** for a plan.
4.  Click the **Plan** tab.
5.  Click **Activate** Plan.

The ACTIVE check box displays as enabled on the Plan page.

To deactivate an active plan, follow these steps but click Deactivate
Plan.

**NOTE**: Deactivating a plan is not the same as deleting a plan. If a
plan is deleted, all of the tasks assigned to the plan are also deleted.
