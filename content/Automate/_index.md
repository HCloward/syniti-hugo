# Automate Overview

Automate, a middleware tool, is a DSP® WebApp that allows automated
processing of tasks. An interface can be designed using events, stored
procedures, workflows, etc. to manage a complete business process.  The
interface can then be scheduled to run automatically during off hours. 

For example, Automate could connect various corporate systems with SAP
and allow data to flow smoothly between them based on exact
specifications. An Interface Designer can rapidly deploy new interfaces
or can modify the existing interfaces without weeks of designing and
programming.

Automate uses ANSI Standard SQL as its ELT language. It supports FTP,
workflow and interactive web pages for managing data repair and error
handling.

Automate can support any native DSP® response capability including:

  - Stored Procedures
