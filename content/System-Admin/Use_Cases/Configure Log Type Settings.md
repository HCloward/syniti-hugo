# Configure Log Type Settings

The DSPÂ® is installed with logs that are created daily, and track
errors, warnings, user logins and other items. A user can set the number
of days logs are retained before they are deleted and whether a log is
active (i.e., whether records are written to the log).

To configure log type settings:

1.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Setup \> Log Types** in the
    *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Edit** for a log type.
    
    [*View the field descriptions for the Log Types
    page*](../Page_Desc/Log%20Types.htm)

3.  Enter a value in the **RETENTION DAYS** field.
    
    **NOTE**: After this number of days has passed, the log is deleted.
    For example, if the field contains 0, the log is deleted daily. If
    the value is 10, the daily log is retained for 10 days and deleted
    on day 11.

4.  Enable or disable the **ACTIVE** check box as needed.
    
    **NOTE**: If a log type is not active, no records are added to the
    log.

5.  Click **Save**.
