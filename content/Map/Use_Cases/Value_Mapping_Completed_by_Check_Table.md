# Value Mapping Completed By Check Table

This chart displays the number of value mappings that are in process and
the number that are complete for the check tables selected on the
*[Value Mapping](../Page_Desc/Value_Mapping.htm)* page.

Hover a cursor over the Completed section to view the count of Completed
value mappings. A value mapping is completed after it has been mapped on
the *[Value Mapping (Legacy to
Target)](../Page_Desc/Value_Mapping_Legacy_to_Target_H.htm)* page.

Hover a cursor over the In Process section to view the count of in
process value mappings. A value mapping status is in process if a field
on a check table has not been mapped and the NOT RELEVANT check box is
disabled on the *Value Mapping (Legacy to Target)* page.

Click a bar to open the <span style="font-style: italic;">Value
Mapping</span> page to view the status of each check tableâ€™s value
mapping. The MAPPED PERCENT field displays the mapping status for each
check table.
