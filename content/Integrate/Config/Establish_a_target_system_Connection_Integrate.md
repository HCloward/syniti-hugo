# Establish a Target System Connection

The target system connection allows for the set up and configuration of
instances that Integrate uses throughout the posting process.

This instance is used for:

Posting data

  - Gathering metadata about templates

  - Recording a BDC Script or GUI Script
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: This is used for SAP
    connections only.

  - Providing an RFC/BAPI to use to post data
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: This is used for SAP
    connections only.

  - Providing a data source for transfer of user defined files
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: The instance to
    transfer files to or post data to may be overridden at the process
    post level.

Target system connections are added and maintained in Common.
