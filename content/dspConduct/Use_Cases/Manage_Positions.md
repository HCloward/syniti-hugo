# Manage Positions

A position is a security template defined by a Security Administrator to
which multiple users can be assigned. With positions, a Security
Administrator can create a template for security once and assign
multiple users to the template as needed.

Position security is used to establish security for users in the Content
WebApp.

When a user is assigned to a position, the position establishes the
business processes, roles, and for each role through org units, the
subset of data users can access in the Content WebApp.

Based on categories and the governance elements set up within a
category, business processes, roles, and org unit values for a role
category level can be included or removed from a position. Org unit
values can also be included or removed from a role at the role level.

**NOTE:**When positions are changed in dspConduct™, the changes
automatically result in changes to what business processes, roles, and
data the users can access in the Content WebApp.
