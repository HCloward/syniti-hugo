# Unlock User Accounts

A user account becomes locked after:

  - **Ten unsuccessful login attempts**. The default value for Maximum
    Login Attempts, set on the
    *[Parameters](../Page_Desc/Parameters_All_TabsSysAdmin.htm)* page,
    can be updated. After the maximum number of unsuccessful login
    attempts, the user must wait 300 minutes until the user account and
    password can be used to log in, unless the Administrator unlocks the
    account. This Login Attempt Lockout Period can also be updated on
    the *Parameters* page.
  - **Ten days without logging in,** if the Disable Inactive User Period
    check box is unchecked on the *Parameters* page. This period can
    also be updated, or this feature can be turned off by checking the
    check box.

To unlock a user account:

1.  Select **Security \> Users (Locked)** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Select the **USER ID**.
3.  Click the **Unlock** icon on the Page toolbar.
