# Assign Column Properties

Column Properties are used to control the behavior of fields on a page.
Control items, such as List Boxes, Buttons, Labels, and Images, define
how columns work with selected properties.

Refer to [Design Pages f](Page%20Design%20Guidelines.htm)or general
information.

A user must be assigned to the Power User WebApp group for the WebApp to
work with column properties for pages in that WebApp.

Column properties are applied to
<span id="Page Column View Type" class="popUpLink">view types,</span>
which determine the context in which the control appears as configured.
Refer to [Use View Types with Column
Properties](Use%20View%20Types%20with%20Column%20Properties.htm) for
more information.

In most cases, when adding a column, the View Type of *All Views* can be
used. However, column properties can be applied to other views as
needed. For example, a field can be a Combo Box on the *Horizontal*
View, but can be a display-only field on the *Vertical* View. In this
case, set the field as a Combo Box for the View Type of All Views. Add
another record for the field and select a View Type of Vertical, and set
the CONTROL STATUS to Disabled.

**NOTE:** Multiple entries for a column can be created, each having a
different view type.
