# Page Design Overview

After [designing the database](Database_Design.htm) and [creating the
WebApp](Create_a_WebApp_in_DSP.htm), register all pages and assign
properties for the WebApp. Once the pages are registered, they are then
linked to the *Navigation* pane, Configuration Menus, or accessed via
another WebApp page.

Refer to [Page Design Guidelines](Page%20Design%20Guidelines.htm) for
general information.

To create pages for a WebApp:

1.  Register the page. Each page type requires a different process.

2.  [Assign page properties, if creating a Dynamic
    page.](Assign_Page_Properties.htm)
    
    **NOTE:** Dynamic pages can have page properties assigned to
    determine page functionality.

3.  [Assign column properties.](Assign_Column_Properties.htm)

**NOTE:** To create pages, users must belong to the Power User or Power
Designer WebApp group for the WebApp.

Each page has a page type which sets how information displays to a user
and what actions can be taken on a page.

The following sections detail registration for page types.
