# Plan Tasks Versus Work List Items

Plan Tasks can be added to a Project and Plan through an
[import](../Use_Cases/Import_Project_Files_into_dspTrack.htm) or
[manually](../Use_Cases/Add_a_Plan_Task_Manually.htm).

Work List Items are ad hoc tasks that can be added outside of project
and plans.

Work List Items are different from Plan Tasks in that Work List Items:

  - Are not assigned to a plan or project
  - Do not have predecessor tasks, and are never in the status Waiting
    on Dependency
  - Are added on the *Work List Setup* page
  - Cannot be copied
  - Cannot have tags assigned
  - Only display on the *Work List Detail* page when the status is
    Completed
  - Do not have Warn Thresholds applied
  - Do not have a duration or Unit of Measure set
  - Are never included on the Critical Path
  - Are never milestones

Plan Tasks and Work List Items display on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List Setup</span> page. To
differentiate between the two, a Plan Task has a Project and Plan name
in the PROJECT and PLAN fields on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List Setup</span> page. These
fields are blank for Work List Items.

Refer to [Work with Plan Tasks](../Use_Cases/Work_with_Plan_Tasks.htm)
and Â [Work with Work List
Items](../Use_Cases/Work_with_Work_List_Items.htm) for more information.
