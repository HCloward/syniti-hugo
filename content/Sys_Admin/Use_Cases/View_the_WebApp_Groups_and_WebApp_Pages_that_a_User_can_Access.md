# View the WebApp Groups and WebApp Pages that a User can Access

WebApp groups define authorization or access on a page by page basis.
When a user is assigned to a WebApp group, that group controls which
pages the user can access.

Page rights override WebApp group rights. For example, if the WebApp
group permits deletion on a page, but the page security restricts it,
users assigned to the WebApp group are unable to delete records from the
page.

The *[User Group List](../Page_Desc/User_Group_List.htm)* page displays
all groups the user is assigned to. The *[Group Page
List](../Page_Desc/Group_Page_List.htm)* page lists the pages in a
WebApp that a user can access, and what permissions (add, update and
delete) are available to that user on that page.

Refer to [Assign Users to WebApp
Groups](Assign_Users_to_WebApp_Groups.htm) and [Set Page Security for
WebApp Groups](Set%20Page%20Security%20for%20WebApp_Groups.htm) for more
information.

To view user group list:

1.  Select **Admin \> Security \> Users** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click the **Groups** icon to view the WebApp groups the user is
    assigned to.
3.  Click the **Pages** icon to view the pages and page-specific
    permissions associated with that WebApp group.
