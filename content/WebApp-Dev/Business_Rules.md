# Business Rules

During the design of a WebApp, business rules can be incorporated into
each page or for a specific field triggering an action or event. For
example, business rules can be created on the *Customers* page to force
a customer’s name to display in all upper case letters, or to default
**Date Shipped** to be the same as **Order Date**. A page Designer can
add a button with a business rule that, when clicked, runs the rule that
adds one day to the **Date Shipped** date.
