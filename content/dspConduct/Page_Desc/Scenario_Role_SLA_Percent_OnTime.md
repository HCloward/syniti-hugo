# Scenario, Role SLA Percent On Time

When a request is submitted, a due date for each of the request’s roles
is calculated based on the Work Days, Hours and Minutes SLA settings for
the role. As request roles are finished, new due dates are calculated
for subsequent roles whose dependencies are complete.<span> </span> When
charts are produced, these due dates are used to determine the percent
on time values for the specific design element (i.e., category, business
process, scenario, or role) being viewed.<span> </span>

This chart displays the percentage of roles within the specific scenario
completed on time according to established SLA settings based on active
requests. Refer to [Set Up SLA Notifications in
dspConduct™](../Config/Set_Up_SLA_Notifications) for more
information.

Refer to [View Charts in dspConduct™](../Use_Cases/View_Charts) for
