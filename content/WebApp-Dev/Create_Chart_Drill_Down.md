# Create Chart Drill Down

Charts can be linked together or linked to any page type (chart,
dynamic, static, dashboard, header detail, etc.). If a chart is linked
to another page, when a user clicks a chart section (a pie slice in a
pie chart, a bar in a bar chart, etc.), a data page or another chart
displays to show additional details.

To create a drill down to link a chart to any page type:

1.  Access the chart page.

2.  Click the **Change Settings** icon in the Site toolbar.

3.  Click **Design**.

4.  Click **Column Properties**.

5.  Click **Vertical View** for the column that allows a drill down (as
    in, the column on the page that is drilled down to).

6.  Click the **Edit** button.

7.  Select the name of the page to drill down to from the **Link to Page
    ID** list box.

8.  Click **Save**.

9.  Close the *Vertical* View.

10. Click the link for the column to drill down from.

11. Click the **Edit** button.
    
    **NOTE:**   Binding Fields are needed when the linking relationship
    cannot be inferred.

12. Enter the field name to bind to on the drill down in the **Binding
    Field Names** field.

13. Enter the field in the **Shared Fields Names** field.
    
    **NOTE:** Shared Fields are used to pass additional column values to
    the linked page.

14. Click **Save**.
