for the request.

The diagram displays:

    <span style="font-style: italic;">[Request](../Page_Desc/Request.htm)</span>
    page
  - The scenario to which the request belongs
  - Related requests in the scenario and their status
  - The roles in the scenario
  - The status of each role
  - The tasks assigned to each role
  - Whether a role is finished and whether dependencies are complete
