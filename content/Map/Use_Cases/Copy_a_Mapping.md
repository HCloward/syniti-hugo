# Copy a Mapping

A user can view a history of all archived mappings (from System Types)
across all Waves and Process Areas for a field. The user can copy a
specific mapping to use in the selected Target or Source.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Only one mapping can be
copied at a time.

When viewing all mappings for a Source, only Source rules display on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Field Mappings by Target Field (All
Waves)](../Page_Desc/Field_Mappings_by_Target_Field_All_Waves.htm)</span>
page. When viewing all mappings for a Target, only Target rules display.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> If the selected field has
an action (as in, a selection displays in the ACTION column), the Copy
icon is disabled. Fields with an action cannot be copied.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> If the current user is a
member of the Map WebApp groups "Ready Only" or "ValueMapper" and is not
a member of other groups with broader authorization for changes, the
Copy icon does not display. An Administrator assigns users to WebApp
Groups.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Instead of copying a
single mapping, a user can also import all mappings in a mapping set
into a Source from a System Type. Refer to [Import and Export
Mappings](Import_and_Export_Mappings.htm) for more information.

To view all mappings for a field and copy a mapping to the selected
Target or Source in Map:

1.  Select **Map** in the Context bar.

2.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Targets </span>icon on
    the *[Process Area
    Launch](../Page_Desc/Process_Area_Launch_map.htm)* page
    
    Or
    
    Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Targets</span> icon and
    click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sources</span> icon for a
    Target.

3.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mappings </span>icon.

4.  Select a mapping.

5.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">View All Waves
    Mappings</span> icon in the Page toolbar.
    
    **NOTE:** If no rows display on the page, either the field has not
    been mapped in any System Type or the selected field is {Target
    Rules} and so a mapping cannot be copied.

6.  Select a mapping to copy to the selected Target or Source.

7.  Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Copy</span>.
    
    **NOTE:** If more than one mapping is selected, this icon is
    disabled.
    
    **NOTE:** If the selected field has an action (as in, a selection
    displays in the ACTION column), the Copy icon is disabled. Fields
    with an action cannot be copied.

The copied mapping displays on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Field Mappings</span> page with a
Mapping Status and Rule Status of Pending Review.
