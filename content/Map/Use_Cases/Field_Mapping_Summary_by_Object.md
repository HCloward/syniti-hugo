# Field Mapping Summary by Object

This chart displays the number of field mappings that are in process and
the number that are complete for all Targets and Sources associated with
an Object.

When the chart is accessed from the Field Mapping by Wave & Process Area
chart, these counts are for all Objects in the selected Process Area.

for that status.
