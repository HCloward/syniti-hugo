# Changes Weekly By Object

This chart displays a count of all weekly changes for all Object types
in all Targets in the Object selected on the Changes Weekly By Wave &
Process Area chart.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Before data displays on
this chart:

  - Trace must be turned on for the tables, views, functions and
    procedure counts. Refer to [Activate and Deactivate Data
    Sources](../../../Platform/Common/Use_Cases/Activate_and_Deactivate_Data_Source.htm)
    for more information. For Transform, trace should be activated for
    the databases beginning with “dsw."
  - A milestone must be captured. Refer to [Create
