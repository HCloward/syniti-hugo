# Manage Groups

Groups are a free-form way to organize reports, for example, by region
(North America, Europe) or employee type (full-time, contractor). Every
group has one group owner whose task is to manage reports registered to
the group and to define the report-level parameters.

dspMonitorâ„¢ is delivered with a standard set of groups, which can be
modified to allow more granularity in linking reports and users.

This use case covers the following topics:

  - [Create Groups](Create_Groups_dspMonitor.htm)

  - [Group Owner Responsibilities](Group_Owner_Responsibilities.htm)

  - [Register Reports to Groups](Register_Reports_to_Groups.htm)

  - [Register Users to Groups](Register_Users_to_Groups.htm)
