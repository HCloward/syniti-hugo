# Set the Wildcard Character for Filters

The wildcard character is used in filters across the DSP® to restrict
filter results. The character is \* by default.

The wildcard character matches zero or more characters. The following
examples show various uses of the wildcard character and describe the
result of each:

  - Web\* – Matches values that start with Web.

  - \*App – Matches values that end with App.

  - \*WebApp\* – Matches values that contain the word WebApp.

  - \*Web\*App\* – Matches values that contain the word Web App, as well
    as phrases like Web Application.

To set a different wild card character:

1.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Parameters** from the
    *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Search Options** tab.

3.  Click **Edit**.

4.  Enter a wildcard character in the **Search String Wildcard** field.
