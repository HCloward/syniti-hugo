# Create Quick Links

Before creating quick links, verify the steps outlined in [Quick Links
Security](Quick_Links_Security.htm) have been followed.

There is no limit to the number of quick links that can be added. To
conserve space, if the number of non-hidden links (refer to [Show/Hide
Quick Links](Show_Hide_Quick_Links.htm) for more information) plus the
number of group headers is greater than 15, the groups are hidden in
order of the largest number of items, until there are less than or equal
to 15 items total. A consolidated group always appears at the top of the
list, regardless of priority.

There are three ways to create quick links:

1.  [As the logged in
    user](Create_a_Quick_Link_as_the_Logged_In_User.htm) (performed by
    the logged in user)

2.  [By security role](Create_Quick_Links_by_Role.htm) (performed by a
    manager)

3.  [By user](Create_Quick_Links_by_User.htm) (performed by a manager)
