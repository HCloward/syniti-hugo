# Use Tags

A *tag* is an optional label applied to a task or group of tasks. Tags
can ensure that a group of tasks all have the same users, rules
or validations, and can be used to group tasks for reporting purposes.

Tags are further defined by tag types. There are three tag types:

  - **Logic** – When a tag with this tag type is assigned to a task, any
    rules and validations assigned to the tag are executed when the task
    is either started or completed from the Work List.
  - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan</span>– When a tag with this
    tag type is assigned to a task, tasks are grouped for reporting and
    organizational purposes.
  - **Security** <span>–</span> When a tag with this tag type is
    assigned to a task, any users assigned to the tag are assigned to
    the associated task.

Tags can be assigned to multiple tasks. Refer to [Assign a Tag to a
Task](Assign_a_Tag_to_Tasks.htm) for more information.

Tags can be assigned to tasks in two ways:

1.  To assign a tag to several tasks, use the options under
    Configuration \> Tag Type. <span> </span>
2.  To assign multiple tags to a single task, use the options accessed
    from Project \> Plans \> Tasks \> Assign Tags.

**NOTE:** Tags can only be applied to Plan Tasks. They cannot be applied
to Work List Items added via the *Work List Setup* page.
