# Use the Work List

The Work List displays tasks in active plans that are not complete and
are assigned to the logged in user. To activate a plan, refer to
[Activate and Deactivate a Plan](Activate_and_Deactivate_a_Plan.htm) for
more information.

A Work List Item, created on the *Work List Setup* page (Configuration
\> Work List) displays on the Work List after it has been created. Work
List Items are not associated with plans, so do not require plan
activation to display.

Plan Tasks and Work List Items display on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List Setup</span> page. To
differentiate between the two, a Plan Task has a Project and Plan name
in the PROJECT and PLAN field on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List Setup</span> page. These
fields are blank for Work List Items. Refer to [Plan Tasks versus Work
List Items](../Page_Desc/Plan_Tasks_Versus_Work_List_Items.htm) for more
information.

To access the Work List, click the blue tab on the Quick Panel. The
number on the tab indicates how many incomplete tasks are assigned to
the logged in user.

**NOTE**: To close the Work List, click the X in the Page toolbar.

The Work List’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Horizontal</span> View
allows a user to:

  - View the schedule status of a task. Refer to [Set Parameters for
    Schedule Status
    Calculation](Set_Parameters_for_Schedule_Status_Calculation.htm) for
    more information about how a schedule status is set for a task.

  - Upload a file to a task. Refer to [Upload Files to a Plan, Task or
    Work List Item](UpldFilesfoProjTaskWrkListItem.htm) for more
    information.

  - Access a page with binding criteria if a task has Work List binding
    criteria configured. Refer to [Add Work List Binding Criteria to a
    Work List Item or Plan Task](AddWrkLisBindingCriteriaItem.htm) for
    more information.

  - Move tasks through the workflow by clicking the Next Action icon.
    When the user hovers the cursor over the Next Action icon, the tool
    tip displays whether clicking the Next Action icon will start or
    finish the task.

  - Track the status of each Plan Task or Work List Item as it moves
    through the workflow from Ready to In Progress. Once a task is in
    Completed status, it no longer displays on the Work List. Completed
    Plan Tasks display on the *Plan Task* page and the *Work List
    Detail* page. Completed Work List Items display on the *Work List
    Detail* page only.
    
    **NOTE**: Refer to [Task Status](../Page_Desc/Task_Status1.htm) for
    more information about how Plan Tasks and Work List Items move
    through the workflow.

  - View additional details about tasks such as task status, planned
    start date and planned finish date.

  - Access the *Work List Detail* page to view the tags and resources
    associated with a task. Refer to [View Work List
    Details](View_Work_List_Details.htm) for more information.

On the Work List’s *Vertical* View, a user can:

  - Add a comment.

  - Add a late comment.
    
    **NOTE**: Comments or late comments may be required, depending on
    how the task is configured. Refer to [Set Comment Requirements for
    Tasks](Set_Comment_Requirements_for_Tasks.htm) for more information.
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: The Late Comment icon
    is disabled when the schedule status for a Plan Task or Work List
    Item is not late (i.e., its schedule status is on time (green) or
    behind (yellow)). The Late Comment icon is only available when a
    Plan Task or Work List item's schedule status is late (red).

  - Access a page that is bound to the selected Plan Task or Work List
    Item without passing binding criteria. Work List Binding Criteria
    sets the key to pass to a page. After binding criteria is added to a
    Work List Item or Plan Task, when a user clicks the link for the
    page on the Work List, the page opens with the data associated with
    the key displayed. <span>If the user clicks the Unbound Page icon,
    no binding criteria is passed to the page.</span> Refer to [Add Work
    List Binding Criteria to a Work List Item or Plan
    Task](AddWrkLisBindingCriteriaItem.htm) for more information.
    
    **NOTE**: A user’s security settings will affect whether the user
    can access the page, and if the user can update data on the page.

  - View the Microsoft Project ID for the Plan Task, if the task was
    added during an import. Refer to [Import Project Files into
    dspTrack™](Import_Project_Files_into_dspTrack.htm) for more
    information.
