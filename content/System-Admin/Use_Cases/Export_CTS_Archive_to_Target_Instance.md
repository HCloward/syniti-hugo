# Export CTS Archive to Target Instance

Archives are exported to a target instance. One of two ways can be used
to export a package, depending on the client’s process:

  - **Programmatically** — Use the process provided in the DSP®.
  - **Manually** — Locate the package on the source web server and move
    it to the correct folder on the target web server. Then, import the
    package through the DSP®. Refer to [Import Archive on the Target
    Instance](Import_Archive_on_the_Target_Instance.htm)  for detailed
    information.

To export an archive to the target instance:

1.  Select **CTS \> Archives** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Export** for archive to move the file to a designated
    instance.

3.  Click **Edit**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the CTS Package Export

5.  Click **Save**.
