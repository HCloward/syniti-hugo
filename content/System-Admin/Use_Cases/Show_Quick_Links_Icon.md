# Show Quick Links Icon

To manage and navigate to quick links, the quick links feature must be
enabled. Enabling this feature adds a new Quick Links icon to the Site
toolbar, which is available even when there are no links defined.

The user who is using the quick link must log in to the DSPÂ® and follow
these steps to display the Quick Links icon.

**NOTE**: These steps must be followed regardless of how the quick link
is created (either by the logged in user or by a manager creating a
quick link for the user or for a security role).

To show quick links:

1.  Click **Gear** icon on the Site toolbar.

2.  Click **Preferences**.

3.  Enable **Show Quick Links** check box; the Quick Links icon displays
    on the Site toolbar.
