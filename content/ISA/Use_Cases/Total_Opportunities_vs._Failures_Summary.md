# Total Opportunities vs. Failures Summary

This chart displays the number of records assessed by an IS rule vs. the
total number of records that failed the rule. Through rule binding,a
rule might be applied to multiple fields. For example, a ‘business
required field’ rule might be bound to two different fields in a table,
name1 and name2. If the table of data has 1000 records and name1 is
empty for 100 records and name2 is empty for 100 records the error count
is 200 and the chart indicates that 200 records failed out of a possible
2000 assessed records giving a 10 % failure rate.  

Hover the cursor over the bar to see the total record count.
