# View Your Filters

The *Your Filters* page displays all filters assigned to the logged in
user. Filters are a way to customize which subset(s) of data users see
through their set of assigned reports. All reports assigned to the user
are filtered by these fields, provided that the report assigned contains
any one or more of the referenced fields.

Filters allow a report to be distributed to various users while limiting
content to individual users based on user filters.

To view filters, click **Your Filters** in the *Navigation* pane. Refer
to [Define
Filters](Configure_User_Settings_Reports_and_Filters.htm#Define_Filters)
for detailed information.
