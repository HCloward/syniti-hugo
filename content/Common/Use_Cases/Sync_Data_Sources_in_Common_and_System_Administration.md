# Sync Data Sources in Common and System Administration

When an Administrator registers a data source in System Administration,
it is available in Common on the <span style="font-style: italic;">[Data
Source Registry](../Page_Desc/Data_Source_Registry_H.htm)</span> page. Â 

However, after the initial record is added to Common, changes made to
data sources in System Administration are not applied to data sources in
Common. Changes made to data sources in Common are reflected in data
sources in System Administration when the data source record is saved or
validated in Common.

On the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Source Registry</span>
page in Common, a data source that has been updated in System
Administration displays the Out of Sync icon in the OUT OF SYNC column.
To view the updates in System Administration, the user clicks the Admin
Data Source icon.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> A user must have access to
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Sources</span> page in System
Administration to view these updates.

The user can either:

  - Apply the updates made to the data source in Common to the data
    source in System Administration by validating or saving the record
    in Common.
  - Apply the updates made to the data source in System Administration
    to the data source in Common manually.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> If a data source is
deleted in Common, the corresponding data source is deleted in System
Administration. If a data source is deleted in System Administration,
the Common data source is not deleted.

To view changes made to data sources in System Administration:

1.  Select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Common \> Configuration \>
    Data Source Registry</span> in the
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Navigation</span> pane.
2.  Locate a data source that displays the Out of Sync icon in the
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">OUT OF SYNC</span> column.
3.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Admin Data Source</span>
    icon to view the changes made to the data source in System
    Administration.

To update the data source in System Administration with changes made to
the data source in Common, use the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Data Source Registry</span> page in
Common and save the data source record.

To update the data source in Common with changes made to the data source
in System Administration, apply the changes manually on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Data Source Registry</span> page.
