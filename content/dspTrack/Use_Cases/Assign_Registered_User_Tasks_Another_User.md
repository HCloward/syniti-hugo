# Assign a Registered User's Tasks to Another User

If the name in the NAME field on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Plan User Registration</span> page is
changed to match a User ID that is already in the Platform, all of the
user’s assignments for that plan will be assigned to that user in the
Platform.

To update the user name if necessary:

1.  Click **Project** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Plans** for a project.

3.  Click **VerticalView**.

4.  Click **Security** tab.

5.  Click **Register Unregistered Users**.
    
    **NOTE**: A list of unregistered users displays that were imported
    with the project file. If no users display, all users imported with
    the project file are registered in the Platform.

6.  Click **Edit** for the user.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Plan User Registration
    page](../Page_Desc/Plan_User_Registration.htm)

7.  Enter the updated name in **NAME** field.

8.  Click **Save**.

For example, a project file is imported into dspTrack™ that contains a
user who is not registered in the Platform with the User ID BFranklin.

A dspTrack™ Administrator registers BFranklin in the platform using the
*<span>Plan User Registration</span>* page.

The dspTrack™ Administrator then decides to assign BFranklin’s tasks to
another user already registered in the platform with the user ID of
RJones. When the user ID in the NAME field is updated to RJones on the
*Plan User Registration* page and saved, all of the tasks once assigned
to BFranklin are assigned to RJones.
