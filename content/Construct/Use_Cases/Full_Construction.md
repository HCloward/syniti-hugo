# Full Construction

A {Full Construction} Source is added in Target Design.

In cases where no legacy data is available, a user can assign a Source
of Full Construction, which can be used as a single Source or as one of
multiple Sources for a Target.

For example, a Full Construction page could be created to build a
certain material type, such as a service material for the MARA Target.

Metadata fields allow users to see how far along the construction
project is towards completion. They are:

  - The number of records in the construction table.
  - The number of estimated records to be completed (as in, the number
    of active fields in the Target).
  - The number of records that are completed.

**NOTE**: The criteria for a record in the construction table to be
considered construction complete is developed and applied at a clientâ€™s
site based on client and Target system requirements.

These fields display on pages in Construct on the *[Construct
Object](../Page_Desc/Construct_Object)*, *[Construct
Target](../Page_Desc/Construct_Target)* and *[Construct
Page](../Page_Desc/Construct_Page)* pages and are used in the
Construct charts, accessible from Console and Target Design. Refer to
[View Dashboard in Construct](View_Dashboard_in_Construct) for more
information.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: A Utility Target cannot
use {Full Construction} as a Source data source.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: New custom pages and
existing custom pages created with Full Construction can use [Excel
Integration](../../../Platform/Excel_Int/Use_Excel_Integration) and
[Bulk Execution](../../../Platform/Bulk_Exec/Use_Bulk_Execution).
