# Add Roles

Roles are used for notification purposes, such as emailing information
pertinent to the completion of an interface. Roles allow multiple users
to receive notifications for the different interfaces running.

A *Business role* and a *Development role* can be assigned to each
interface. These roles can receive notification emails depending on
notification options. Refer to [Set Up Notifications for an
Interface](Set_Up_Notifications_for_an_Interface.htm) for more
information.

After a role has been added, users and their associated instances are
assigned to the role.

**NOTE:** The email addressed configured to the user assigned to the
Admin role is used as the From address for the interface notification
emails. Assign a user to the Admin Role under by editing the Admin Role
field on the [*Parameters*](../Page_Desc/Parameters.htm) page.

    page](../Page_Desc/Roles.htm)
