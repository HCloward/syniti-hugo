# Database Design

All WebApps are based on a database which is registered as a data source
in DSPÂ®. Each page in the WebApp is based on a table and view in the
database. Additional tables and views can be created and registered as
list boxes, combo boxes, business rules, validation rules, workflows,
control views and more.

This section contains these topics:

  - [Create Views in SQL](Create_Views_in_SQL.htm)
