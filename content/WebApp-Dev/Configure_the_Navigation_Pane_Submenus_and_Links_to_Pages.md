# Configure the Navigation Pane, Submenus and Links to Pages

SQL table data is presented through standard views when registered in
the DSPÂ® server throughout the web interface. Create pages and
additional menus by registering tables and views from the underlying
database to link them together.

Once built, the WebApp layout contains menus that link to pages. Some
menus are automatically created and added to the *Navigation* pane when
the WebApp is built. Additional pages and menus are manually added to
the *Navigation* pane. WebApps commonly contain a *Configuration* menu.
