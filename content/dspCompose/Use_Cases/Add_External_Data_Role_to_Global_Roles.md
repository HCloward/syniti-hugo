# Add External Data Role to Global Roles

The External Data role type is available with dspCompose™, but an
external role should be manually added to the global roles before adding
it to a template.

To add the External Data role:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Roles** on the
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Navigation</span> pane.

2.  Click **Add**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Roles
    page.](../Page_Desc/Roles_H.htm)*

3.  Enter a value in **PRIORITY** field.
    
    **NOTE**: The PRIORITY determines the order the roles are processed
    in a request. The initial role in the template should have the
    lowest priority. This value can be changed at the template level.

4.  Enter a name for the role in **ROLE ID** field.
    
    **NOTE**: This name displays on pages throughout dspCompose™.

5.  Enter a brief description of the role in **DESCRIPTION** field.

6.  Select **External Data** from the **ROLE TYPE** list box.
    
    **NOTE**: An External Data role is another type of Data role.

7.  Click **Save**.
