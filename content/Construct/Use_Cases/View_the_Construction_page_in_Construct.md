# View the Construction Page in Construct

In Construct, view the page created when a {Full Construction} Target
Source is saved in Target Design.

To view the page in Construct:

1.  Click **Objects** on the *[Construct
    Launch](../Page_Desc/Construct_Launch.htm)* page.

2.  Click the **Targets** icon for an Object.

3.  Click the **Construct Pages** icon for the Target.
    
    **NOTE**: The page that opens displays information about all of the
    construct pages that have been created for the Target.

4.  Click the **Construct Page** icon for a page to view the actual
    page.

Users enter data on this page to document the legacy data that does not
exist in the Source. Completion of the construct process for the page is
tracked on the Construct charts. Refer to [Track Construction
Status](../../../Platform/Common/Use_Cases/Track_Construction_Status.htm)
and [View Dashboard in Construct](View_Dashboard_in_Construct.htm) for
more information.
