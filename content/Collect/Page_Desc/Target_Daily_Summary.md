# Target Daily Summary

This chart displays the duration of time in seconds it took to refresh
all active tables from all registered data sources into a target
database for each day. Hover a cursor over a data point and the date,
target name and number of seconds display .On  this chart, a user can
view daily fluctuations in duration of table refreshes that may be
caused by changes in system resources, tables being added or deleted
from the refresh, or other factors

Targets are destination databases (registered as data sources in the
platform) where tables are refreshed with source data using Collect.

Each target is represented as a separate line on the chart.

Refer to [View Dashboard in
Collect](../Use_Cases/View_Dashboard_in_Collect) for general
information about how data displays on dashboards.

To access the chart in Collect, click
