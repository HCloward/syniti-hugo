# Add Comment Codes

An administrative user can add comment codes.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: The Late Comment icon is
disabled when the schedule status for a Plan Task or Work List Item is
not late (i.e., its schedule status is on time (green) or behind
(yellow)). The Late Comment icon is only available when a Plan Task or
Work List item's schedule status is late (red).

To add a comment code:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Late Comment Codes** in *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Add**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Comment Codes
    page](../Page_Desc/Comment_Codes.htm)

3.  Enter the code name in **CODE NAME** field.
    
    **NOTE**: The code name displays on the *Item Comment Code* page
    when the user clicks Late Comment on the *Vertical* View of the Work
    List and the *PlanTask* page. The user selects it when adding a late
    comment.

4.  Enter a description of the code in **CODE DESCRIPTION** field.

5.  Click **Save**.

**NOTE**: A comment code cannot be deleted if it assigned to a task.

A user can assign multiple comment codes to a task.
