# Source Rules (Active) By Object

This chart displays all Source rules with a status of Active for all
Objects in the Wave and Process Area selected in the Context bar.

Source rules clean and massage Source data before it is loaded in the
Target table. The final Source rule (the rule with the highest priority)
pushes the data into the Target table from the Source.

Hover a cursor over the bar to view the total count of active Source
rules.

Click the bar to drill down to the [Source Rules (Active) By
Target](Source_Rules_Active_by_Target.htm) chart.

Refer to [View Dashboards in
Transform](View_Dashboards_in_Transform.htm) for general information
