# Add Layouts

A system administrator can add layouts. A layout controls how charts
display on a dashboard page. Several layouts are delivered; however,
they cannot be modified.

The *[Layouts](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Layouts.htm)* page can be accessed
through the *Navigation* pane, but it is more often accessed as part of
creating a dashboard. The user clicks the + icon in the Layout ID field
on the *Vertical* View of the
*[Pages](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Pages_H.htm)* page to access the
*Layouts* page to add the layout as part of dashboard creation. Refer to
[Create a Dashboard](Create_a_Dashboard.htm) for more information.

A user can also add a layout from the *Layouts* page, and then add the
dashboard.

**NOTE**: Because a layout can be assigned to multiple dashboards pages,
the layout cannot be modified once assigned. This is to avoid a change
to a layout cascading to all assigned dashboards pages with potential
undesired results.

The delivered layouts can be copied and modified. Refer to [Copy a
Layout](Copy%20a%20Layout.htm).

If a custom layout needs to be modified, it must be unassigned from the
page.

For general information about dashboards, refer to [Create Dashboards
and Charts.](Dashboards_and_Charts.htm)

To add layouts from the *Layouts* page:

1.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Layouts** in the *Navigation*
    pane.

4.  Enter one or more characters of the layout template name to select a
    layout template from the **LAYOUT TEMPLATE ID** list box.
    
    **NOTE**: Optionally, click the Combo Box Filter icon to open a
    *Vertical* View that displays a preview of layout templates. Click
    **Choose Record** to select a layout template.

5.  Click **Save**.

6.  Click the **Layout Frames** icon.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Layout Frames
    page](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Layout%20Frames.htm)

7.  After creating a custom layout and layout frames, assign pages to
    the layout frames defined for the layout template selected when
    [Creating a Dashboard](Create_a_Dashboard.htm).
