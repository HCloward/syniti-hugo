# Request Objects Creation Log

<div class="use">

Use this page to [view a log of
objects](../Use_Cases/Auto_Generate_Request_related_Objects#View_the_Request_Objects_Creation_Log)
created when the request-related objects are auto-generated.

</div>

There are two methods to access the page.

To access the log at any time:

1.  Click **dspConduct \> Design** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click **Vertical View** for a category.
3.  Click the **Rules and Actions** tab.
4.  Click the **Request Table and Views Creation Log** icon.

The log can also be accessed on the *[Default WebApp Request
Table](Default%20WebApp%20Request%20Table)* page by clicking
Creation Log in the Page toolbar. However, it is only accessible on that
page until objects are built. Once objects are built and the user
navigates away from the *Default WebApp Request Table* page, that page
is no longer
accessible.
