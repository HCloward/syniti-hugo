# Configure Workflow Summary User Settings

Users receive workflow emails as notifications for various processes,
such as when a table fails to download or when a table completes a
download. The summary email is sent once daily at a user selected time,
but can be sent on demand. Refer to [Send Workflow Summary On
Demand](Send_Workflow_Summary_On_Demand.htm) for detailed information.

To configure workflow summary settings for a user:

1.  Select **Administrative \> Workflow Summary User Settings** in
    *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **WORK FLOW SUMMARY** check box for the TARGET and USER NAME
    combination to enable the summary for that user.
