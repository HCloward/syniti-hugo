# Set Up Security for dspConduct™

To set up security:

1.  Create User Accounts in
    [Common](../../../Platform/Common/Use_Cases/Create_User_Accounts_in_Common.htm)
    or have an Administrator [create them in System
    Administration](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Create_User_Accounts_in_System_Administration.htm).
    
    **NOTE**; Adding a user in Common allows for a more streamlined
    process for password maintenance, and is the recommended method for
    use by a Help Desk or Call Center. In Common, password maintenance
    is the user’s responsibility. In System Administration, the
    Administrator must add a password for the user. Aside from password
    maintenance, after the user account is created, there is no
    difference between a user account added in Common or System
    Administration.
