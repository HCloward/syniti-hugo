# View Field Groups

Field groups are filters used to create subsets of data in a Target
field. Based on values in another related field, these subsets can have
different settings, such as criticality, whether the field is required
or which rules will run against the field. If, for example, a field is
required only under certain data conditions, field groups are used to
define the conditions, fields, values, and requirement setting.

Field groups are created in Target Design and are used on the *[*Field
Mappings*](../Page_Desc/Field_Mappings_H.htm)* page in Map. To view
field groups, select ProcessArea \> Targets \> Field Groups.

Refer to [Work with Field
Groups](../../Design/Use_Cases/Work_with_Field_Groups.htm) for more
information.
