# View Your Group Reports

This page displays all a groups to which the logged in user has access.

Reports can only be configured by a Group Owner. Refer to [Group Owner
Responsibilities](Group_Owner_Responsibilities.htm) for detailed
information.

To view Your Group Reports:

1.  Click **Your Groups** in *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Reports** icon.

3.  Click the **View** icon to view the report data.
    
    Or
    
    Click the **Download a file** icon to download the report data in a
    file.
    
    **NOTE:** Download a file is only active:
    
      - Once the report has been executed by clicking the Execute icon
        on the *Vertical* View and the total number of records is
        greater than zero,
        
        Or
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
      - If the report has been recently generated through a scheduled
        process.
    
    **NOTE:** Be aware of Microsoft Excel and the Platform record
    limitations for large reports. The Excel limitation is 65K records
    for large reports for version 2003 and older, and roughly 1 million
    records for version 2007. If Excel 2007 is used to generate large
    reports, increase the **Report Autogenerate Size** parameter
    (Configuration \> Parameters). The Platform limits a file size of 10
    MB to be uploaded; a file over 100K records is typically over 10 MB.
     Users can also generate CSV or TXT files to support larger records
    sets with smaller file sizes.  dspMonitor™ also supports xlsx if the
    client has the correct version of Microsoft Office.
