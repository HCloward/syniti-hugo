# Use Comment Codes

Depending on how dspTrack™ is configured, a user may be required to
select a comment code when a task is completed after the planned finish
date.

Refer to [Set Comment Requirements for
Tasks](Set_Comment_Requirements_for_Tasks.htm) for more information.

A user can also add a comment code even when not required to do so.
Comment codes are available for all tasks in all plans.

Reports are included with dspTrack™ that list counts of tasks, tags, and
codes by comment code: Late Reason by Plan, Late Reason by Tag and Late
Reason by Code.

dspTrack™ is installed with standard comment codes:

  - Configuration
  - Error in Development
  - Late Dependency
  - Low Task Time Estimation
  - Pending Business Action
  - Pending Validation
  - Requirements Change
  - Resource/Time Constraints
  - Security
  - System Performance

An administrative user can [add comment codes](Add_Comment_Codes.htm).

To use comment codes:

  - [Set a Comment Code for a Work List
    Item](Set_a_Comment_Code_for_a_Work_List_Item.htm)
  - [Set a Comment Code for a Plan
    Task](Set_a_Comment_Code_for_a_Plan_Task.htm)
