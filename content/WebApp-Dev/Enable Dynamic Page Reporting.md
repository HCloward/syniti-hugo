# Enable Dynamic Page Reporting

Reporting can be enabled for any Dynamic page. Dynamic page reporting is
controlled by the Support Report option. When this option is selected,
the Report option is available from the Page Options drop-down (small
gear) on the Dynamic page.

is only required for Dynamic pages.

2.  Click the **Pages** icon for a WebApp.
3.  Click **Vertical View** for the page.
4.  Click the **Report Options** tab.
5.  Enable the **Support Report** check box.
6.  Optionally: select and assign the report view defined for the
    specific Dynamic page report.
