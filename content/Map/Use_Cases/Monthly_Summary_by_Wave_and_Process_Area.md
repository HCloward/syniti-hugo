# Monthly Summary By Wave & Process Area

This chart displays the number of mappings per status for all field
mappings in the Wave and Process Area in the Context bar for the month.
The number in the x-axis is the number of the month in the year. For
example, 2014-01 is January of 2014.

The Total Mappings is the count of active fields in the target.

Hover a cursor over a data point to view the number of field mappings in
that status for the Wave and Process Area for that month.

Click the line for a Wave and Process Area to drill down to the
*[Objects](../Page_Desc/Objects_map)* page to view the objects that
