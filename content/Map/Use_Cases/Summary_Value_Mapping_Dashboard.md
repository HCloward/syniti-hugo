# Summary Value Mapping Dashboard

In value mapping, an individual value in a source field is configured to
be converted to a value that the target system accepts in the target
field. For example, the source system may store USA in the Country
field, while the target system uses the value US. Value mapping converts
the source value to the target value for every occurrence of the source
value in the field.

Refer to [Perform Value Mapping](Perform_Value_Mapping.htm) for more
information.

Select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Process Area Launch \> Value
Mapping \> Tracking Value Mapping</span> for a check table to view a
summary of value mapping status for that check table.

A summary of value mapping status associated with the check table by
day, week and month is also provided.

This dashboard contains the following charts:

  - [Value Mapping Completed By Check
    Table](Value_Mapping_Completed_by_Check_Table.htm)
  - [Value Mapping Daily By Check
    Table](Value_Mapping_Daily_by_Check_Table.htm)
  - [Value Mapping Weekly By Check
    Table](Value_Mapping_Weekly_by_Check_Table.htm)
  - [Value Mapping Monthly By Check
    Table](Value_Mapping_Monthly_by_Check_Table.htm)
