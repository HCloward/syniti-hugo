# Access Targets at the Object Level

In Console, Objects are added and assigned to a Wave-Process Area to
create a context.

Refer to [Add an
Object](../../Console/Use_Cases/Add_Elements_Separately#Add3) for
more information.

Targets can then be added to an Object in Target Design.

A user can drill down from the Object level to view and access all
Targets for an Object.

To access Targets at the Object level in Target Design:

1.  Click **Design** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Objects**icon on the [Design](../Page_Desc/Design)
    page.
    
    **NOTE**: The Objects that are available are those Objects that have
    been assigned to the Wave-Process Area in Console to create a
    context. The current context displays in the Context bar.

3.  Click the **Targets** icon for an Object.

All Targets assigned to the selected Object display.
