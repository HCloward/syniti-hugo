# Build an Archive from a Package

Once the package is created, attributes are added and the packing list
is reviewed. The archive is then built.

To build the archive:

1.  Select **CTS \> Build** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Build Archive** for the package to create an installable
    archive from the package; a confirmation message displays.

3.  Click **Ok**.
    
    **NOTE:** If items were excluded from the packing list, a
    confirmation message displays to verify the list was modified and
    the package has not been rebuilt.
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> After the Archive has
    been uploaded to the target system, select **CTS \> Archives** in
    the *Navigation* pane. Locate the archive and click the **Manifest**
    icon. This will give you the list of items included in the archive.
    Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">History</span> icon to
    view details about each build for the selected archive.
