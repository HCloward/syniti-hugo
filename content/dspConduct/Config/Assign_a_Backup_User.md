# Assign a Backup User

There may be occasions when a user is unavailable for a period of time
and there may be a need for a backup user to perform their tasks during
their absence. A Security Administrator has the ability to assign a
backup user with a start and end date to a primary user, and a user can
assign a back-up user to their account.

Upon assignment, the backup user retains their original security rights,
acquires all security rights given to the primary user and then can
perform the tasks of the primary user. The backup user ID retains these
rights for the duration of time between the start and end date. After
the end date, the backup user loses the security rights obtained from
the primary user. Â 

To assign a backup user:

1.  Select **dspConduct \> Security** in the *Navigation* pane or, if
    the Security menu is expanded, click **User Settings**.
    
    **NOTE:**To set a back-up user for yourself, select **dspConduct \>
    Security \> My Settings** in the *Navigation* pane.
