# Use Auto Register to Add Users to WebApp Groups Automatically

When using Integrated Authentication, if a majority of new users require
a common set of WebApp Group memberships, use the Auto Register feature
to automatically create users and add them to WebApp Groups when users
attempt to access the site for the first time.

**NOTE:** Consider the security implications of enabling Auto Register.
Anyone with a valid domain login who attempts to access the site will
automatically gain permissions to the DSPÂ®.

**NOTE:** Auto Register has no effect on the group memberships of
existing users.

To auto register users to a WebApp group:

1.  Select **Admin \> Security \> WebApp Security** in the *Navigation*
    pane.
2.  Click the **Groups** icon for the WebApp.
3.  Click **Vertical View** for a WebApp group.
4.  Click the **Auto Register** check box to enable it.
