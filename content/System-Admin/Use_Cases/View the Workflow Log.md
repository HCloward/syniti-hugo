# View the Workflow Log

Each time the DSP® sends a workflow message to a user, it is recorded in
the workflow log. The log displays information that can assist in
troubleshooting such as whether the workflow was sent successfully, when
the workflow was sent, and who received (or should have received) the
message.

Workflow settings for delivered components are configured from within a
component. Workflows are sent from dspTrack™, dspMonitor™, dspCompose™,
dspConduct™, ISA, and Collect.

The log also tracks details about custom workflows. Refer to [Workflow
Views](Workflow_Views.htm) and [Create a
Workflow](../../WebApp_Dev/Create_a_Workflow.htm) for more information.

**NOTE**: A Workflow Log is retained for the number of days set on the
*[Parameters](../Page_Desc/Parameters_All_TabsSysAdmin.htm)* page’s
Workflow Log Retention Days setting. After the retention days have
passed, the log is deleted.

To view the workflow log, select **Admin \> Resources \> Workflow Log**.
