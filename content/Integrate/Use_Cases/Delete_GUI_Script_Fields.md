# Delete GUI Script Fields

<span id="Post Data using a GUI Script Steps" class="popUpLink">\>Review
the steps in the process. </span>

GUI script fields are individual fields that capture data during the GUI
script recording. If redundant steps were created during the recording,
delete the field instead of re-recording the script.

Delete GUI script fields on the *GUI Script Data* page by clicking
**Delete** for the record.
