# Send Workflow Notifications when a Final Finish Package Fails

If a Final Finish package is created but does not run successfully, a
user who belongs to the Final Finish Admin WebApp group receives a
workflow notification. These users have read-only access to all requests
across categories, and can ensure that the issue is investigated by the
proper resources.

A user can receive a workflow email, view the notification as a popup
message from within dspConduct, or both. Refer to [Set User Workflow
Receipt Preferences](Set_User_Workflow_Receipt_Preferences.htm) for more
information.

An Administrator adds users to WebApp groups. Refer to [Assign User to
WebApp
Groups](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Assign_Users_to_WebApp_Groups.htm)
in System Administration for more information.
