# View Your Groups

The *Your Groups* page displays all groups containing reports assigned
to the logged in user. While a Group Owner can process a group, which
runs all reports for all users, users can process their groups, which
runs all reports for the group and the single user.Â 

Groups can be configured by a Group Owner. Refer to [Group Owner
Responsibilities](Group_Owner_Responsibilities.htm) for detailed
information.

To view groups, click **Your Groups** in the *Navigation* pane.
