# Target Weekly Summary

This chart displays the duration of time in seconds it took to refresh
all active tables from all registered data sources for a target database
for each week. Hover a cursor over a data point and the week, target
name and number of seconds display. On this chart, a user can view
weekly fluctuations in duration of table refreshes that may be caused by
changes in system resources, tables being added or deleted from the
refresh, or other factors

The number in the x-axis is the number of the week in the year. For
example, 201401 is the first week of the year.

Targets are destination databases (registered as data sources in the
platform) where tables are refreshed with source data using Collect.

Each target is represented as a separate line on the chart.

Refer to [View Dashboard in
Collect](../Use_Cases/View_Dashboard_in_Collect) for general
information about how data displays on dashboards.

To access the chart in Collect, click
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary Dashboard</span> in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Navigation</span> pane.
