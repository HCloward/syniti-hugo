# Configure Request Statuses

The number of days a request is active is controlled by the
<span id="dspCompose Request Status" class="popUpLink">request
status.</span> The Request Status Parameters feature enables users to
define a Default Retention Interval to each request status type. The
Default Retention Interval controls how many days requests of a certain
Request Status remain active before they are archived. The Default
Retention Interval is applied to all new templates. Modify the Default
Retention Interval if the defaults are not appropriate.

**NOTE**: These request statuses were installed with the platform cannot
