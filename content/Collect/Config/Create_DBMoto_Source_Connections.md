# Create DBMoto® Source Connections

If using DBMoto® and downloading (replicating) data from a database
other than Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server or IMB DB2 LUW (where
connections are created automatically), create a DBMoto® source
connection.

To create a DBMoto® source connection:

1.  Check that the database is supported by contacting the DBMoto®
    support team at
    [http://support.boaweb.com](http://support.boaweb.com/).
2.  Launch DBMoto®.
3.  In the Metadata Explorer, expand the
    **DBMoto\_Client**.**metadata**.
4.  Right-click **Sources** and select **Add New Connection**.
5.  In the Source Connection wizard, set values that match the
    connection specified in Collect on the *Target Sources* page.
6.  Complete the wizard and check that the connection has been created
    in the Metadata Explorer.
7.  Create additional connections as needed.

For additional help with DBMoto®, click **F1** from within DBMoto®.
