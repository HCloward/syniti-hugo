# Configure Authentication Settings

An Administrator can configure different authentication modes
([Basic](Configure%20Basic%20Authentication.htm),
[Integrated](Configure%20Integrated%20Authentication.htm), and
[Custom](Configure%20Custom%20Integration.htm)) to access the platform.
A user can also be set up to [log in as an anonymous
use](Configure%20Anonymous%20Authentication.htm)r.

**NOTE**: Either Basic or Integrated authentication must be supported to
log in to the DSP®. If both types are enabled, the DSP® attempts to
authenticate the user by Integrated authentication, then by Basic
authentication.

Authentication settings are configured on the Security Settings tab on
the *[Parameters](../Page_Desc/Parameters_All_TabsSysAdmin.htm)* page.
