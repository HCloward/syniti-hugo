# View a Role's Scenarios and Tasks

A Designer can view the tasks that are assigned to a role and the
scenarios to which the role is assigned to evaluate overall business
process design and how updates to a role may affect other elements that
are assigned to that scenario.

To view a diagram illustrating the relationships between the selected
role, the scenarios to which it is assigned, and all tasks assigned to
the role:
