# Getting Started with DSP® Security for Delivered Components

To get started with DSP® security for delivered components:

1.  [Create User
    Accounts](Create_User_Accounts_in_System_Administration.htm)
2.  [Create Security Roles](Create_Security_Roles.htm)
3.  [Assign Users to Security Role](Assign_Users_to_Security_Roles.htm)
4.  [Assign WebApp Groups to Security
    Role](Assign_WebApp_Groups_to_Security_Role.htm)
5.  [Assign Keys to Security Role](Assign_Keys_to_Security_Role.htm)

To set up user-specific security that allows users to view a more
granular layer of data, complete the above steps plus add a
user-specific key. Refer to [Establish User-Specific Security
Definitions](Establish_UserSpecific_Security_Definitions.htm) for more
information.

Certain components require additional security configuration.
