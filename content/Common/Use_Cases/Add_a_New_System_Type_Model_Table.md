# Add a System Type Model Table

An Administrator performs this task to document which tables are
required to be populated when building the System Type.

The System Type model must be [added](Add_a_New_System_Type_Model)
before this task can be performed.

For the System Type import to work, all tables on the [System Types
Model Tables](../Page_Desc/System_Types_Model_Tables) page must
exist and contain data.

The following System Type models and associated tables are delivered
with the product:

To add a System Type model table in Common:

1.  Select **Configuration \> System Type Models** in the *Navigation*
    pane.

    Models](../Page_Desc/System_Types_Models_H)* page.

    descriptions and check tables. Otherwise, the import fails.

5.  Click **Save**.
