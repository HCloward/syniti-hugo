# Configure Import / Export Types

The Import/Export Type controls how data is imported into Transform or
how data is exported from Transform. While Transform is delivered with
predefined Import/Export Types, additional types can be added.

A Source can be imported into a Transform object’s database, which can
then be used as the Source table.

Target exports are the last sets of rules to move the Target data to a
location so that it can be staged for export to an ERP system using a
load tool.

**NOTE:** Though the installed settings can be edited, they cannot be
deleted.

To add an Import/Export Type in Transform:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Setup \> Import / Export Types (Setup)**
    from the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Add**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Import/Export Types (Setup)
    page.](../Page_Desc/Import_Export_Types_Setup.htm)*

3.  Enter a name in the **TYPE** field to uniquely identify the Import
    or Export type.

4.  Enter a brief description in the **DESCRIPTION** field.

5.  Click the **IMPORT** check box to mark the resource as an import. 

6.  Click the **EXPORT** check box to mark the resource as an export.

7.  Click the **DATA SOURCE ID REQ** check box if a data source is
    required for the import or export.

8.  Click **Save.**
