# Hide Columns on a Pageâ€™s Filter View

When a user clicks the Page Settings icon (the small gear labeled with
More Actions on a page), the Filter view displays. By default, all
columns on the *Horizontal* View display on the Filter view, except for
columns:

  - With a Control Status of Hide for the All Views View Type
  - That have the control of image, button, label, tab or toolbar

A Page Designer can exclude columns on a page in a Custom WebApp from
the filter view, preventing users from filtering data using the values
in these fields.

To hide a column on the Filter View:

1.  Select **Admin \> WebApps** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click the **Pages** icon for a WebApp.
3.  Click the **Column Properties** icon for a column.
4.  Click **Add**.  
    *<span>View the field descriptions for the Page Columns
    page.</span>*
5.  Select a column to hide on the Filter View from the **COLUMN** list
    box.
6.  Select Filter (Form) from the **VIEW TYPE** list box.
7.  Select Hide from the **CONTROL STATUS** list box.
8.  Click **Save**, the *Vertical* View displays.
9.  Click **Save**.
