# Create Quick Links as the Logged In User

Quick links are essentially book marks.

Create a quick link to book mark a page following the steps below. Any
filtering, binding and shared criteria is saved as part of the quick
link so that when the link is accessed, the user is returned to the page
in the same state as it was when the quick link was created. Row
selection or other content-specific actions are not saved.

To create a quick link:

1.  Enable Show Quick Links. Refer to [Show Quick Links
    Icon](Show_Quick_Links_Icon) for detailed information.

2.  Navigate to the page within the component to book mark as a quick
    link.

3.  Click **Quick Links** icon on Site toolbar.

4.  Click **Add Current Page**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Quick Links
    page](../Page_Desc/Quick_Links_H)

5.  Enter the order in which quick link displays on the *Quick Links*
    page in **Priority** field.

6.  Â Enter a name for the quick link in **Label** field.

7.  Click **Save**.
