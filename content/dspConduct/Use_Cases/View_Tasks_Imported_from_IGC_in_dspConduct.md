# View Tasks Imported from IGC™ in dspConduct™

After tasks are published in IGC™, they are imported into dspConduct™
via a service page that runs every 30 minutes. A user with security can
access the *Services Pages* page in System Administration (Admin \>
Resources \> Service Pages) to change the service page schedule as
needed or manually run the service page to import tasks immediately.
Refer to [Start and Stop Service
Pages](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Stop_and_Start_Service_Pages.htm)
in System Administration for more information.

After IGC™ tasks have been imported, they display on the *[IGC
Task](../Page_Desc/IGC_Task.htm)* page, where they can be reviewed and
mapped to dspConduct™ tasks.

A Process Designer can also update mappings or add dspConduct™ tasks to
IGC™ tasks as needed from this page at any time.

To view tasks imported from IGC™:

1.  Click **dspConduct™ \> Design** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click the **IGC™ Tasks** icon for the category.
