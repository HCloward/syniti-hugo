# Unlock Records

A user that has the ability to add or edit the contents of a page with
Excel Integration enabled can perform this task.

In order for a user to import records during the import process, the
records must be unlocked. If the records are locked during the import
process, they are listed as failed on the Excel Integration panelâ€™s
Import Results tab.

Locked records are indicated by a padlock symbol in place of the pencil
icon used for editing.

The user is notified as to which records are locked and by whom before
unlocking them.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Only records locked via
Excel Integration can be unlocked on the Excel Integration panel.

To unlock records:

1.  Navigate to the page where the records are locked.

2.  Select **Excel Integration** from the page gear menu; the *[Excel
    Integration](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Excel_Integration_Panel)*
    panel displays.
    
    **NOTE:** There is a warning message on the panel stating the number
    of records that are locked and that those records will not be
    included in the download.

3.  Click the **Unlock Records** icon; a popup alert displays.

4.  Click **OK**.
    
    **NOTE:** The Locked By and Locked On values are cleared, and the
    records are unlocked. The Excel Integration panel closes.
