# Configure Business Processes in a Position

A Security Administrator can add business processes to a position to
configure which business processes the position can access.

Business processes can be included in a position from multiple
categories. This allows the Security Administrator to include roles and
org units from multiple categories in a position.

Before performing this task, design the governance elements in
dspConduct™ \> Design and add a position. Refer to [dspConduct™ Design
Process Overview](dspConduct_Design_Process_Overview.htm) and [Add a
Position](Add_Position.htm) for more information.

To configure business processes in a position in dspConduct™:

1.  Select <span style="font-weight: bold;">dspConduct \>
    </span>**Security \> Positions** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Business Processes** icon for a position.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Position Business Process
    page](../Page_Desc/Position_Business_Process.htm).*

3.  Select one or more business processes, and then click the
    **Include** or **Remove** icon as needed.
    
    **NOTE:** The Include All option allows the user to include all of
    the business processes in the position without having to scroll
    through the list and select them all first.

Next, [configure roles in a
position](Configure_Roles_in_a_Position.htm).
