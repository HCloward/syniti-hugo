# Add a Task

On the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Task](../Page_Desc/Task_H.htm)</span>
page, a Designer can register a web page created in the Content WebApp
or a page in the platform as a task.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: Pages in the platform are
limited to pages in the default WebApp. The default WebApp is set at the
Category level. Refer to [Create a Category](Create_a_Category.htm) for
more information.

One or more tasks that have been added to the category can be added to a
role. A particular task can only be added to a role once.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: Any Task pages that are of
type Application must be registered on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[dspConduct™
Task](../Page_Desc/dspConduct_Task_H.htm)</span> page. dspConduct™ does
not create task pages with an Application type. These pages are created
in the Content WebApp.

To add a task in dspConduct™:

1.  Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">dspConduct \> Design
    </span>in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Navigation</span>
    pane.

2.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tasks</span> icon for a
    category.

3.  If no tasks exist, the page displays in add mode. Otherwise, click
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span>.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Task
    page.](../Page_Desc/Task_H.htm)

4.  Select the name of the page in the platform or the name of the page
    in the Content WebApp from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">TASK
    ID</span> list box.
    
    **NOTE:** This is the page where the task is performed.

5.  Select the task type from the
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">TYPE</span> list box.
    
    Task types are:
    
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Application</span> – Identifies
        tasks that gather, enter or makes changes to data using pages in
        the Content WebApp for preparation to send to the system(s) of
        record.
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Display</span> – Identifies
        tasks that can be viewed but cannot be changed.
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Review</span> – Identifies
        tasks that evaluate and review data, either approving or
        rejecting all changes made within the execution of a request.
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Post</span> – Identifies tasks
        that post data to a target system, after the Application and
        Review roles have been completed.

6.  Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>.
