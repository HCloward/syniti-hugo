## DSP® Overview

The Data Stewardship Platform (DSP)® delivers the core data quality,
data migration and information governance functionality.

## Common

Common is a collection of functions used throughout the DSP and the
solutions, such as System Types, duplicate detection, database profiling
and scheduling.

## Collect

Collect maintains a unified collection of data from multiple, disparate
systems. It connects to a variety of data sources to extract and collect
data into a single, unifying database. Collect provides the option to
use DBMoto® to pull data from source systems.

## Integrate

Integrate is a component of the DSP used in the Integration phase of a
data migration project. The tool contains loading mechanisms to push
data into target ERP system using

  - Batch Data Communication (BDC) processing
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI) scripting
  - A Remote Function Call (RFC) or a BAPI
  - An SAP Data Services Job

Integrate can also create and transfer user defined text files formatted
as Delimited, Fixed Width, or XML to the SAP server.

## dspTrack™

dspTrack is a project tracking tool used to ensure project tasks are
completed according to a project schedule and to alert managers when
tasks and projects are in danger or being late or are late. The
parameters for schedule status calculation can be fine tuned so that
managers and resources can most effectively meet project deadlines.
Dependency types for tasks ensure that tasks occur in the right order to
complete the project efficiently.

## DSP Add-Ons

An Administrator user can use DSP Add-Ons to create custom security for
delivered WebApps or custom WebApps. By creating Custom WebApp groups,
users can easily customize access for pages depending on any
organizational need. Refer to [DSP Add-Ons]() for more information.

## Assemble

Assemble is an import and export tool that allows for the creation and
execution of packages that transfer data between two sources.
