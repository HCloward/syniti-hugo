# Configure Security Tags

Once a tag with a Security tag type has been added, it can be further
configured by adding users to the tag. These users are then assigned to
any task to which the tag is assigned.

To add a user to the tag:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Tag Type** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the icon for the Security Tag Type.

3.  Click **Registrations** for the tag.

4.  Click **Users**.

5.  Select a **USER ID**.
    
    **NOTE**: To select a contiguous range of users, hold down the Shift
    key and select the first and last users in the range. To select a
    noncontiguous range of users, hold down the Ctrl key and select each
    user ID.

6.  Click **Add to Tag**.

**NOTE**: Follow the above steps to remove a user from a tag, and click
Remove from Tag.

Refer to [Assign a Tag to Tasks](Assign_a_Tag_to_Tasks) to continue
with configuring security tags.
