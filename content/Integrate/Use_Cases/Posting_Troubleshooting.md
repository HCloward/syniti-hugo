# Posting Troubleshooting

Sometimes the best way to determine a problem with a post is to manually
step through the post process and examine each step in the post with the
actual data being processed. Integrate provides two separate mechanisms
to enable this manual step-through processing â€“ SM35 session creation
for BDC postings and GUI Debug Script creation for GUI script postings.
