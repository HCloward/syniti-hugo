# Service: Queue Health (Hourly)

This chart displays the percentage of jobs in a given queue that contain
errors. This chart is helpful to monitor the health of specific jobs,
which are grouped by resource type:

  - **Background Event –** The background service controls the job queue
  - **General –** The job is on the General queue
  - **Index –** The job is on the Index queue
  - **Service Page –** The associated Service page controls the job
    queue

Hover a cursor over a chart data point to view details of that page,
including the error rate, and date and time the job type ran.

Refer to [View Resource Charts in System
Administration](../Use_Cases/View_Resource_Charts_in_SystemAdmin.htm)
for more information about chart features and the data that displays on
charts.
