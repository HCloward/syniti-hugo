# Add a Data Source that Stores Views for Import

A request can be created based on a view stored in a data source. Refer
to [Import a View at the Request-Role
Level](Import_a_View_at_the_Request%20Role_Level.htm) for more
information.

At the template-role level for the Data role, add data sources that
store the views that can be imported for requests based on the template.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Data sources cannot be set
for the Review or Post role.

To set the data source:

    Navigation pane.

    tab.

6.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">View Import
    Allowed</span> check box to enable it.
    
    **NOTE:** If enabled, a view can be imported for a request based on
    this template if a data source has been added to the template role.

7.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">View Import Data
    Sources</span> icon.
    
    **NOTE:** The number on this icon is the count of data sources that
    have been added to the template role.

8.  Click a <span style="font-weight: bold;">DATA SOURCE NAME</span>.
    
    **NOTE:** To select a contiguous range of records, hold down the
    Shift key and select the first and last records in the range. To
    select a noncontiguous range of records, hold down the Ctrl key and
    select each record.

The ALLOWED check box is enabled for the selected data source,

as a basis for a request based on this template.
