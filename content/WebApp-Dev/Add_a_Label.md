# Add a Label

Label is a Control Type that displays a label to distinguish between
*Vertical* View sections.

**NOTE:** The label must be added to the SQL View with NULL in the
**Column** column and the label title in the **Alias** Column before the
label can be created.

**NOTE:** DSPÂ® adds spaces to words based on the placement of capital
letters in field names. Therefore, all multiple-word field names should
be concatenated with capital letters that serve as the demarcation point
between the words. The column then displays with the appropriate spaces
on the page.

To add a label:

1.  <span id="Column Properties Navigation" class="popUpLink">Access the
    *Page Columns* page</span>.

2.  Click **Add**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Page Columns
    page](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Page_Columns_H.htm)*

3.  Enter name of the label in the **COLUMN** field.

4.  Select **Vertical** in the **VIEW TYPE** field.

5.  Select **Label** from the **CONTROL** List Box.

6.  Click **Save**.

**NOTE:** On the *Vertical* View, a user can set the Collapse option.
When enabled, a plus or minus sign displays next to the label, and the
user can click it to expand or collapse the fields beneath the label.
