# Create Report Pages

A Report page has a subset of the features available on a Dynamic page.
Report pages are not editable. They do not have a *Horizontal* or
*Vertical* View, only a report view. Like a Dynamic page, a Report page
supports report groups for organizing a denormalized data set. Refer to
[Create Report Groups](Create%20Report%20Groups.htm) for more
information.

In addition, by default a Report page can be rendered as a report when
the user clicks the **Report** option from the Page Options (small gear)
drop-down.

A Report page can be filtered in the same way that a Dynamic page can be
filtered. A user can also download the report data.

A Report page can link to another Report page, producing drill-down
reports. Refer to [Configure Report Generation for Linked
Pages](Configure%20Report%20Generation%20for%20Linked%20Pages.htm) for
more information.

To create a Report page and register the view:

1.  Select **Admin \> WebApps** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Pages** icon for a WebApp.

3.  Click **Add**.
    
    [View the field description for the Pages
    page](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Pages_H.htm)

4.  Enter the report name in the **DESCRIPTION** field.

5.  Select **Report** from **PAGE TYPE** list box.
    
    **NOTE**: Since a Report page is read only, do not select a table.

6.  Click **Save**, the *Vertical* View displays.

7.  Select the new report from **Report View** list box.
    
    **NOTE**: Refer to [Create Report
    Views](Create%20Report%20Views.htm) for more information.

8.  Click **Save**.
