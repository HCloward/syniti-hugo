# Add Custom Requirement Settings

Requirement settings can be set for a Target field and are used for
reporting purposes.

Four requirement levels are installed by default. These DSP-supplied
values cannot be edited or deleted.

The values are:

  - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Business Required</span> – Required
    to meet a business rule or otherwise meet a business need
  - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Technical Required</span> –
    Required by the system
  - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conditional</span> – Required
    depending on certain conditions
  - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Optional</span> – Not required

New Requirement settings can be added. Once saved, these settings are
available for selection in the REQUIRED list box on the *[Target
Fields](../Page_Desc/Target_Fields_H_Target_Design.htm)* page.

To add a Requirement setting in Target Design:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Required** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Add**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Required
    page](../Page_Desc/Required.htm)*

3.  Enter the name of the Requirement setting in the **REQUIRED** field.
    
    **NOTE**: This name displays as an option in the REQUIRED list box
    on the *Target Fields* page.

4.  Enter a description of the setting in the **DESCRIPTION** field.

5.  Enter the order of the level in the **PRIORITY** field.

6.  Click the **ACTIVE** check box to uncheck it, if needed.
    
    **NOTE**: The check box is checked by default. If the check box is
    unchecked, the requirement setting is not available in the REQUIRED
    list box on the *Target Fields* page.

7.  Check the <span style="font-weight: bold;">VALIDATION</span> check
    box if the field requires that a validation be run against the data
    entered in the field when the record is saved.
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: This field is for
    documentation purposes only.

8.  Click **Save**.
