# Improve Data Extraction Efficiency

Use the following tips to improve efficiency when using one of the
outlined extraction methods:

  - **Dedicated hardware –** The fewer applications and users sharing
    the same hardware, the better and more consistent the performance.
  - **High speed connectivity –** Bandwidth is often a bottleneck.
  - **Extract only relevant tables –** Clearly define the tables that
    are in scope for extraction.
  - **Extract only relevant records/and or columns from tables –**
    Excluding fields that are not being used effectively makes a
    narrower table. In some cases, the client may request that certain
    sensitive fields be excluded from extraction altogether. Adding
    relevancy (for example, pulling only active customers) also reduces
    the amount of data being extracted.
  - **Create a development environment with comparable performance to
    production environment –** The testing and configuration process is
    critical. Testing in an environment that closely mimics that of
    development provides a much more accurate picture of performance and
    behavior.
  - **Baseline and monitor extraction performance –** Variables that
    impact efficiency change over time and it is important to monitor
    performance. Such variables include record volumes, changes in
    hardware or software, changes in business processes or protocols,
    and load on the network.
