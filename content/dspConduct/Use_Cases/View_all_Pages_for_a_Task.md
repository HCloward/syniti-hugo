# View all Pages for a Task

A task defines a unit of work and is associated with the web page or
group of web pages where the work is performed. A Designer can view all
of a task’s associated pages and how these pages are accessed on the
[Task Page](../Page_Desc/Task_Page_H) page.

Information including page name, page type and parent task is available
for each page.

The page type is created when the page is initially defined, and sets
how the page is laid out or how the page is used. A Header/Detail layout
page defines a split pane page with header data in the parent page and
details about the record selected in the header on the details page.

The page level provides information about which pages are top level
pages (i.e., a page that is not accessed from another page) and has a
page level of 0. Child pages, which are accessed directly from the
parent page, have levels of 1, 2 and so on.

These pages are then added to a scenario \> role \> task combination,
and can be viewed on the [Scenario Role Task
Page](../Page_Desc/Scenario_Role_Task_Page) page.

To view a task’s pages:
