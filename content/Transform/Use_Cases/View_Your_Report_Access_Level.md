# View Your Report Access Level

A Business user can view whether a report has sensitive data and whether
that user has access to it on the *Vertical* View of reports.

To view the report access level for the current user via the *[Report
Quick List](../Page_Desc/Report_Quick_List.htm)* page in Transform:

1.  Select **My Report \> Report Quick List** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click **Vertical View** for a report.

To view the report access level for the current user via the [All
Reports (By Object)](../Page_Desc/All_Reports_By_Object.htm) page in
Transform:

1.  Select **My Report \> All Reports** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click the **All Reports** or **Actionable Reports** icon for an
    object.
3.  Click **Vertical View** for a report.

The Access section displays the Sensitive and All Access settings.

  - If the lock icon displays for the Sensitive field, the report is
    sensitive. If the unlock icon displays for the Sensitive field, the
    report is not sensitive.
  - If the key icon displays for the All Access field, the user has all
    access.  If there is no icon for the All Access field, the user does
    not have all access granted.
