# View Your Favorite Reports

A subset of frequently used reports can be marked as favorites to make
accessing them faster. These reports display on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Your Favorite
Reports](../Page_Desc/Your_Favorite_Reports_H)</span> page.  

For example, a user may need to review a subset of reports at the end of
the month. These reports could be added to the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Your Favorite Reports</span> page and
easily accessed during that time.
