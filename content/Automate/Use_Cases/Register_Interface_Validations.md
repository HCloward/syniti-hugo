# Register Interface Validations

Validations can be registered at the interface level and at the event
level.

An interface validation (on the**[Interface
Validations](../Page_Desc/Interface_Validations) page) runs to
validate that the interface completed processing successfully.

An interface event validation (on the *[Interface Events
(Validations)](../Page_Desc/Interface_Event_Validations)* page) runs
on an individual event registered to an interface.

There are three types of interface validations available at both levels:

  - [ExternalProcess](Register_External_Process_Validations) (a
    plugin)
  - [StoredProcedure](Register_Stored_Procedure_Validations)
  - [View](Register_View_Validations)
