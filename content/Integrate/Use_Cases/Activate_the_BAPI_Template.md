# Activate the BAPI Template

<span id="Post Data using a BAPI Steps" class="popUpLink">\>Review the
steps in the process. </span>

Before a template can be added to a process, it must be activated.

To activate a template on the Template page:

1.  Click **ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE** button; a confirmation message
    displays.

2.  Click **Ok**.
    
    **NOTE**: An active template displays a check mark in the ACTIVE
    column and a green icon in the ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE column.

The activation process validates the BAPI against SAP as well as
extracts field information. Once a template is activated, it cannot be
edited until it is deactivated.
