# Create WebApp Groups using the *Groups* Page

The platform is delivered with a set of WebApp groups. Users can also
create custom WebApp groups. Depending on specific business
requirements, any number of groups can be created.

The ability to create WebApp groups via the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Groups</span> page is provided for the
WebApp Designer, allowing the Designer to build their application and
assign pages and page access to the WebApp group.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: </span>When a WebApp group is
added to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Groups</span> page, it is
synched with the list on the <span style="font-style: italic;">WebApp
Groups</span> page.

To create a WebApp group:

1.  Click **WebApps** on *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Groups** for a WEB APP NAME.

3.  Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add.</span>
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Groups
    page](../Page_Desc/Groups.htm)

4.  Enter name in **GROUP NAME** field.

5.  Click **Save**.

**NOTE:** WebApp groups can also be created from the *WebApp Groups*
page. However, pages are only assigned to WebApp groups through the
*Groups* page.
