# Add a Category Object

A category object defines the kind of master data a WebApp is expected
to process (i.e., the object(s) the category supports, such as Material,
Customer or Vendor).  For example, a category object called “Material”
processes tasks based on adding or maintaining Material data. A category
can support one category object.

A category object can be used by multiple categories.

Category objects must be registered (no standard values are delivered).
These objects are selected on the *[Category Org Unit
Type](../Page_Desc/Category_Org_Unit_Type.htm)* page for each category.

**NOTE:** If category objects do not exist, the category name is used as
the category object name. The category name is automatically added to
the *[Category Objects](../Page_Desc/Category_Objects.htm)* page and
does not need to be added manually as described in the steps below.

To add a category object manually:

1.  Select <span style="font-weight: bold;">dspConduct </span>**\>
    Design** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vertical View</span> for a
    category.

3.  Click the **Org Unit Types** icon.

4.  If no records exist, the page displays in add mode. Otherwise, click
    **Add**.

    page](../Page_Desc/Category_Org_Unit_Type.htm)

5.  Click **Click to add a new item;** in the **OBJECT NAME** list box,
    the *[Category Objects](../Page_Desc/Category_Objects.htm)* page
    displays in add mode in another browser tab.
