# Edit Connections to Target Systems at the Process Post Level

A Process Designer can reuse a process template by adding connections to
load programs for multiple target systems to a single process template.
Data can then be posted to these target systems sequentially.

Before performing this task, [Set Available Connections at the Process
Template Level](Set_Connections_at_the_Process_Template_Level.htm).

Refer to [Post Data to Multiple Target Systems with One Process
Template](Post_Data_to_Multiple_Target_Systems_with_One_Process_Template.htm)
for general information.

After the available connections are set for a process template, the
process post uses the default connection. If a connection other than the
default connection must be used, a user can update the connection at the
process post level.
