# Archive a Plan

dspTrack™ allows a user to archive a plan for reporting purposes. When a
plan is archived, dspTrack™ stores a copy of that plan and the date the
archive was saved<span> </span> in an archive table, and the data can
then be used as the basis for reports.

To archive a plan:

1.  Click **Project** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click **Plans** for a project.
3.  Click **Vertical View**.
4.  Click **Archive** tab.
5.  Click **Create New Archive**.

**NOTE**: When the process is complete, the Last Archived On field
display the date and time of the archive, and the Last Archived By field
displays the user name of the user who clicked Create New Archive.

**NOTE**: There is no limit to the number of archives that can be saved,
and archives must be deleted manually from the archive table to be
removed.

<span>**NOTE**:</span> The ability to archive data is not restricted by
security roles. Any user who can access the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Vertical</span> View of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Plan</span> page can archive plan
data.
