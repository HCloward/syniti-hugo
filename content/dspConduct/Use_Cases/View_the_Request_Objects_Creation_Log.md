# View the Request Objects Creation Log

This log displays all the log records that are written when the stored
procedures registered to Build Objects execute as the Request-related
objects are created.

There are two ways to access the log.

To access the log at any time:

1.  Click **Design** in the Navigation pane.
2.  Click **Vertical View** for a category.
3.  Click the **Rules and Actions** tab.
4.  Click the **Request Table and Views Creation Log** icon.

The log can also be accessed on the *[Default WebApp Request
Table](../Page_Desc/Default%20WebApp%20Request%20Table)* page by
clicking Creation Log in the Page toolbar. However it is only accessible
on that page until objects are built. Once objects are built and the
user navigates away from the *Default WebApp Request Table* page, that
page is no longer accessible.

**NOTE**: Records remain in the log unless they are manually removed.

**NOTE**: If a Category is deleted, the log records associated with that
Category are also deleted.
