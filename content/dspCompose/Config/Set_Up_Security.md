# Set Up Security for dspCompose™

To set up security for dspCompose:

1.  [Create User
    Accounts](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Create_User_Accounts_in_System_Administration.htm)
    (performed by an Administrator)

2.  [Grant the user access to a WebApp
    Group](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Assign_Users_to_WebApp_Groups.htm)
    in dspCompose (performed by an Administrator)

3.  [Grant Users Access to Post Monitor Group in
    Integrate](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Grant_Users_Access_to_Post_Monitor_Group_in_Integrate_in_System_Administration.htm)
    (optional) (performed by an Administrator). An Administrator must
    assign users to the Post Monitor group in Integrate for them to
    successfully post using the Post Later feature in dspCompose.

    template. Refer to [Add Users to
    Templates](../Use_Cases/Add_Users_to_Templates.htm) for more
