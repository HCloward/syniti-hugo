# Configure the Post Later Feature at the Scenario - Role Level

A Designer can configure a feature that allows a Role Processor with the
Post role type to schedule a post to process at a specified date and
time. The setting can be configured for a specific scenario \> role
combination. It is at this level that access to the Post Later feature
is controlled.

Refer to [Schedule a Post for a Specified Date and
Time](Post_a_Request.htm#Schedule_a_Post_for_a_Specified_Date_and_Time)
for more information.

Before performing this task, [Design a Governance
Hierarchy](dspConduct_Design_Process_Overview.htm) and [add a
role](Add_a_Role.htm) with the Post role type.

The setting can be configured at the role level and can cascade down to
the scenario role level. Refer to [Configure the Post Later Feature at
the Role Level](Configure_the_Post_Later_Feature_at_the_Role_Level.htm)
for more information.
