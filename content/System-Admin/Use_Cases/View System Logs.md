# View System Logs

A System Administrator can view information about access changes made
for entities, authentication attempts when users log in to the DSP®, and
changes to system configuration on the System Logs pages.

When an entity’s security access is changed, the change, such as adding
a user to a WebApp Group, is logged on the *[System Logs (Access
Changes)](../Page_Desc/System%20Logs.htm)* page.

When a user logs in to the DSP®, the attempt, whether failed or
succeeded, is logged on the *[System Logs (Authentication
Attempts)](../Page_Desc/System%20Logs.htm)* page.

System configuration changes, such as security related changes to
Parameter pages, are logged on the *System Logs* page.

**NOTE:** All configuration changes must be made through the System
Administration user interface. Changes to configuration made outside of
the user interface are not logged.

To view the System Logs pages, a user must be a member of the
Administrator, Power Designer or Power User WebApp groups for System
Administration.

Refer to [Configure Log Type
Settings](Configure%20Log%20Type%20Settings.htm) for information about
configuring retention days and whether a log is active.

To view system logs:

1.  Click **Admin \> Resources \> System Logs** in the *Navigation*
    pane.
2.  Click the **Log** icon to view the Access Changes, Authentication
    Attempts, or System Configuration Changes log as needed.
