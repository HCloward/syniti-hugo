# Mark Target and Source Instances

Once the instances are set up, the source and target instances have to
be marked appropriately. For example, in order to CTS items from the
Development instance to the QA instance, mark the source instance as
“DEV” and the target instance as “QA.”

To mark the instances as source and target:

1.  Log in to the DSP®  source instance.

2.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Parameters** in the *Navigation*
    pane.

3.  Click the **Site Parameters** tab.

4.  Click **Edit**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Parameters
    page](../Page_Desc/Parameters_All_TabsSysAdmin.htm)

5.  Select the desired instance from the **Instance** list box.
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Only instances added
    on the
    <span style="font-style: italic;">[Instances](../Page_Desc/Instances.htm)</span>
    page display in the Instance list box. Refer to [Set up
    Instances](Set_up_Instances.htm) for detailed information.

6.  Click **Save**.

7.  Repeat all steps for the target instance.
