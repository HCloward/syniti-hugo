# View Transaction Status

A Migration Developer can track transaction status as target tables,
source tables and rules are built during SQL AutoGen.

The <span style="font-style: italic;">[AutoGen SQL
Log](../Page_Desc/AutoGen_SQL_Log.htm)</span> page displays messages
about success or failure and detailed information to troubleshoot issues
so that users can build objects more efficiently.

If AutoGen transactions have generated successfully (for example, the
target table, source table or rules have been built successfully), the
icon is a green check mark. If transactions have failed, a red icon
displays.

If the Log icon is disabled, targets, sources or rules have not been
generated.

To view the log in AutoGen, click the Log icon on the following pages:

  - [Automation](../Page_Desc/Automation_page.htm)
  - [Automation SQL Target
    Source](../Page_Desc/Automation_SQL_Target_Source.htm)
  - [Automation SQL Target Source (Update
    Row)](../Page_Desc/Automation_SQL_Target_Source_Update_Row.htm)
  - [Automation SQL Field
    Mappings](../Page_Desc/Automation_SQL_Field_Mappings_H.htm)
