# View Default Workflow Messages

dspConduct™ is installed with default workflow messages and the
processing to send these messages. By default, dspConduct™ sends
workflow messages to users who have access to a request when a request
is created, canceled, deleted, finished, rejected or reset. A user can
view the default messages that are delivered with dspConduct™ but cannot
change the default messages themselves. Default messages are used as the
starting point for Category Language-specific messages which may be
edited.

Refer to [Edit Category Language-specific
Messages](Edit_Category_Language_specific_Messages.htm) for more
information.

Refer to [Configure Workflow Messages
Overview](Configure_Workflow_Messages_Overview.htm) for general
information.

To view default workflow messages click
