# Manage Business Processes

A business process is a collection of related scenarios used to create,
change or extend an object. The execution of a business process is
determined by the dependencies between scenarios. A business process
must contain at least one scenario but can also contain many.

To work with business processes:

  - [Add a Business Process](Add_Business_Process.htm)

    Parameters](Configure_Business_Value_Parameters.htm)

    Process](Add_a_Scenario_to_a_Business_Process.htm)
