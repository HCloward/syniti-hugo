# Group Owner Responsibilities

Each group has a *group owner* who manages reports registered to the
group and defines the report-level parameters. When the group is
created, the Group Owner is automatically registered as a user for the
group.

Group Owner responsibilities are:

  - [Assign Group Owner to a Group](Assign_Group_Owner_to_a_Report)
  - [Add Users to a Report](Add_Users_to_a_Report)
  - [Add Reports to a Group](Add_Reports_to_a_Group)
