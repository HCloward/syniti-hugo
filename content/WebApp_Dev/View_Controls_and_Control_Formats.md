# View Controls and Control Formats

A system administrator can view the controls and the associated formats.
The controls and formats are shipped with the platform. Controls are
selected from the *[Page
Columns](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Page_Columns_H)* page as part of
page configuration. Refer to [Add a Control Type to a
Column](Add%20a%20Control%20Type%20to%20a%20Column) for more
information.

To view controls:

1.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Setup \> Controls** in the
    *Navigation* pane.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Controls
    page](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Controls)

2.  Click the **Formats** icon, if needed.
