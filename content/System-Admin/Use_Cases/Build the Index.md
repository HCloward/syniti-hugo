# Build the Index

Once an index has been configured, before it can be used:

  - [The index objects must be built.](Build%20Index%20Objects.htm)
  - [The index must be populated.](Populate%20an%20Index.htm)

Before an index can be built, it must be
[created](Create%20an%20Index.htm),
[configured](Configure%20an%20Index.htm), if needed and have at least
one [searchable column](Add%20a%20Column%20to%20an%20Index.htm).
