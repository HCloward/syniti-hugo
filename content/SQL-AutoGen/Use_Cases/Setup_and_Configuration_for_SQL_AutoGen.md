# Setup and Configuration for SQL AutoGen

SQL AutoGen creates basic objects used by the migration process (tables,
rules and reports) so that users can focus on addressing complex
requirements.

Before using SQL AutoGen:

  - [Create the Contexts for Migration
    Projects](../../Console/Use_Cases/Create_Contexts_for_Migration_Projects.htm)
  - Use Target Design to create a target. Refer to [Target
    Design](../../Design/Design_Overview.htm) for more information.

**NOTE:** The target and source tables can be generated after the target
has been designed.

If rules are to be generated:

  - [Add Basic Rules in Target
    Design](../../Design/Use_Cases/Basic_Rules.htm)
  - [Sync Map and Target
    Design](../../Design/Use_Cases/Sync_Map_and_Target_Design_TD.htm)
  - [Perform Field
    Mapping](../../Map/Use_Cases/Perform_Field_Mapping.htm)
