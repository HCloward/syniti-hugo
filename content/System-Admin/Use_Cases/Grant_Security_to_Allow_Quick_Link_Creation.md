# Grant Security to Allow Quick Link Creation

To use the quick links feature, the logged in user must be a member of
the Customizer WebApp group. By default, all users are added to the
Customizer WebApp group. If users are unable to use the quick link
feature, membership to this group may have been removed. Refer to
[Assign Users to WebApp Groups](Assign_Users_to_WebApp_Groups.htm) for
detailed information or contact a site Administrator for assistance.
