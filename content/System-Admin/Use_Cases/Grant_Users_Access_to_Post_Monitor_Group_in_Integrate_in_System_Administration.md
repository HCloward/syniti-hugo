## Grant Users Access to Integrate's Post Monitor Group in System Administration

An Administrator must assign users to the Post Monitor group in
Integrate for those users to successfully post using the Post Later
feature in dspCompose™.

To grant user access to the Post Monitor group in Integrate:

1.  Grant user access to the Power User group in the Data WebApp if a
    different application than dspCompose\_Data is used for pages.
    
    **NOTE:** A UserID is automatically inserted into the Power User
    group for the dspCompose\_Data WebApp when the UserID is added to
    dspCompose™.  If a Webapp other than dspCompose\_Data is used for
    creating pages, all Group permissions for that other WebApp must be
    added manually.

2.  Grant user access to the Requester group in the dspCompose WebApp.

3.  Grant user access to the Post Monitor group in the Integrate WebApp.

Refer to [Assign Users to WebApp
Groups](Assign_Users_to_WebApp_Groups.htm) for more information.
