# Add Attributes

An *attribute* for a CTS package is optional and allows for additional
notes to be added to an archive that would be helpful to include with
the package. Additional notes may include a detailed description of the
archive, or SQL code and instructions for the user installing the
archive to copy and run the SQL before or after the archive is
installed.

To add an attribute to a CTS package:

1.  From the *CTS Build* page, click the **Vertical View** icon for the
    archive.

2.  Click **Attributes**.
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> If records already
    exist, the page displays in Add mode. Otherwise, click
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span>.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the CTS Attributes
    page.](../Page_Desc/CTS_Attributes)

3.  Enter a title for the attribute in the **NAME** field.

4.  Enter notes or instructions in the **VALUE** field.

5.  Click **Save**.
