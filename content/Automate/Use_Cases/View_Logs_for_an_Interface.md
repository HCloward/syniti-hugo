# View Logs for an Interface

Logging allows users to examine how an interface was executed and why it
behaved as it did. Log entries are grouped in tasks in order to provide
a summary of the steps involved in executing an interface.

To view an interfaceâ€™s log in Automate:

1.  Select **Interfaces** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **History** icon for the desired interface.

3.  Click the **Important** icon to view log filtered by tasks with a
    level set at Reporting by Importance Level or above. This icon is
    only enabled of there are tasks to be written to the log for the
    interface according to the level set in the Reporting by Importance
    Level field configured on the
    *[Parameters](../Page_Desc/Parameters.htm)* page.
    
    Or

4.  Click the **All** icon to view the entire log.
