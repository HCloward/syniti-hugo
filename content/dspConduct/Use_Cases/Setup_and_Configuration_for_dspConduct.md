<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> A new data source named
DGE\_ElementDocument\_FilePath whose data source type is “Local File” is
shipped with dspConduct™. Once dspConduct™ has been installed the Path
value must be populated for that DataSource. The Path value is a folder
that already exists on the web server and is the "root" of the path
where all Element Documents are stored on the web server.
