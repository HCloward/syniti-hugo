# Summary Field Mapping Dashboards

Field mapping for a migration project documents how data in the Source
will be mapped to data in the Target system.

Refer to [Perform Field Mapping](Perform_Field_Mapping.htm) for more
information.

The charts display a field mapping summary of all Waves, Waves and
Process Areas, Objects, Targets and Sources, depending on how the charts
are accessed, as well as field mapping changes by day, week and month.

Refer to [View Dashboards in Map](View_Dashboards_in_Map.htm) for
general information about chart features.

Charts are also available that display summary field mapping at the
Wave-Process Area level. Refer to [Metrics Dashboard
Summary](Metrics_Summary_Dashboards.htm) for more information.
