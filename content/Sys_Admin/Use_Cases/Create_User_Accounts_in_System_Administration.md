# Create User Accounts in System Administration

A user account must be created for each user of the DSP®.

**NOTE:** This step is part of the process for setting up security for
DSP® delivered components. Refer to [Getting Started with DSP® Security
for Delivered Components](GettingStartedwDSPSecurityDlvrdComps) for
more information.

**NOTE:** An Administrator can create a user account in Common, which
allows for a more streamlined process for password maintenance and is
the recommended method for use by a Help Desk or Call Center. In System
Administration, the Administrator must add a password for the user. In
Common, password maintenance is the user’s responsibility. After the
user account is created, there is no difference between a user account
added in Common or System Administration.

To create a new user:

1.  Log in to System Administration.

2.  Select **Security \> Users** in *Navigation* pane.

3.  Click **Add**.

8.  Enter a password used in conjunction with the User ID to log in to
    the DSP® in **Password** field.

9.  Enter a name in **Windows User Name** field if Integrated
    Authentication is used by the ID to validate against the Windows
    domain.

10. Enter a date in **Expiration Date** to schedule the user’s access to
    the DSP® to be terminated.

11. Select a page from **Default Page ID** list box.
    
    **NOTE:** The Default Page ID controls the page that DSP® opens to
    when the user logs in. If no ID is selected, the DSP® opens to the
    site menu.

12. Enter a phone number for the user in **Telephone** field.

13. Enter an extension for the user in **Telephone Extension** field.

14. Enter a valid email address for the user in **E Mail address**
    field.
    
    **NOTE:** A valid email address includes an at symbol (@) and a
    period (.). This field **<span class="underline">must</span>** be
    populated for the user to receive workflow emails.

15. Select a locale from **Locale ID** list box.
    
    **NOTE:** The Locale ID translates phrases to the selected language.
    Locales are used to manage different date and number formats.
