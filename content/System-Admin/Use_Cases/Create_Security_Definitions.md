# Create Security Definitions

**NOTE:** This section only applies to custom components and the three
delivered custom components: Construct, MC and dspCompose\_Data. If
using a delivered component, do not alter the delivered security
definitions.

Security definitions are the basis for driving data-based security. They
employ a security view to return data that is then used to dictate what
users are allowed to see on a page.

To enable security for a component of the DSP®, a security definition
must be defined.  The security definition defines what data elements are
used to limit access to records on a page displayed in the DSP®.

**NOTE:** The DSP® is shipped with definitions for all of the delivered
WebApps.  This section is only needed if defining security for a custom
WebApps or for one of the WebApps that are delivered but for which
customizations are allowed.

This section includes the following topics:
