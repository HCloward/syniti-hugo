# Start Work on a Work List Item or Plan Task

A user can mark an item as started on the <span>Work List</span>.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: Depending on how a user's
workflow preferences are set, a resource may receive an email when a
task is in Ready status and work on the item can begin. Refer to
[Receive Workflow Messages](Receive_Workflow_Messages.htm)  for more
information.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Work on a task cannot
start if the task is in a status of Waiting on Dependency. In this case,
if a user clicks Next Action on the Work List, the task(s) and
dependency/dependencies preventing the task from starting display. Work
List Items cannot have dependencies, so will never be in the Waiting on
Dependency status.

To start work on a Plan Task or Work List Item:

1.  Click the blue tab on the Quick Panel to access the **Work List**.
2.  Click the **Next Action** button for the<span> </span>Plan Task or
    Work List Item with a **STATUS** of Ready.

dspTrack™ moves the item's status to In Progress.

Refer to [Task Status](../Page_Desc/Task_Status1.htm) for more
information.
