# Tasks on the Critical Path

Schedule status calculations take the critical path into account. If a
task is in the critical path and it is late, all tasks that are also in
the critical path that occur after the late task are also late.

A task is in the critical path if it is marked as part of the critical
path in Microsoft Project and imported into dspTrack™.

These tasks on the critical path display with a red icon until the
earliest, incomplete task in the critical path is back on schedule.

**NOTE**: If a task on the critical path is late, the task’s plan is
also late.
