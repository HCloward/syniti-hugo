# Work with Objects

An Object is a grouping of Targets and is used to organize business
objects within the data conversion project.

Using Console, an object (or multiple objects) is assigned to a context
(a combination of a Wave and Process Area). A Target and Source (or
multiple Targets and Sources) are then defined for an object in Target
Design. Refer to [Create the Contexts for Migration
Projects](../../Console/Use_Cases/Create_Contexts_for_Migration_Projects.htm)
for more information.Â 

The object assigned to the current context, which displays in the
Context Bar, is the object that displays on the
*[Objects](../../Console/Page_Desc/Objects_H.htm)* page in Transform.

On the *Objects* page, a user can:

  - Click **Reset** or **Process**, which affects all of the objects'
    associated Targets, Target Sources, and their associated rules and
    reports, along with Target exports.
  - Turn report publishing on and off at the object level. Refer to
    [Report Publishing](Publish_Reports_to_Report_Delivery_Pages.htm)
    for more information.
  - Set an object's priority, the order in which the object is
    processed, if multiple objects are assigned to the current context
    and are to be processed simultaneously.

To set priority for an object in Transform:

1.  Select the **Objects** icon from the *[Process Area
    Launch](../Page_Desc/Process_Area_Launch.htm)* page.

2.  Click **Edit** for an Object.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Objects
    page.](../Page_Desc/Objects_HTransform.htm)*

3.  Enter a value in the **PRIORITY** field if there are multiple
    objects assigned to the current context.

4.  Click **Save**.
