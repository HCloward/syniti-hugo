# Register Collect Targets to a Report Repository

A Data Quality Steward can link a report repository to a Collect target
to relate reports to the underlying system, table, and fields that a
rule in the report is querying. This gives the Data Quality Steward the
ability to apply thresholds and view data quality scores at a table and
field level.

To register Collect targets to a report repository.

1.  Select **dspMonitor \> Configuration \> Report Repositories** in the
    *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Collect Targets** icon.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Repository Collect Target
    page](../Page_Desc/Repository_Collect_Target)

3.  Click a row to select a Collect Target.
    
    **NOTE:** Only Collect targets with sources that are active on the
    *[Target
    Sources](../../../Platform/Collect/Page_Desc/Target_Sources_H_Collect)*
    page are displayed.

4.  Click the **Include** icon.
