# Assign a User to a Security Role in Common

Before completing this task, an Administrator:

  - [Creates a User Account in Common](Create_a_User.htm)
  - [Send a Temporary Password for a New
    User](Send_a_Temporary_Password_to_a_User.htm)

An Administrator then assigns a user to a security role. A role is a
single unit used to authorize specified security (such as access to
components, pages, and features) to the assigned user.

To assign a user to a security role:

1.  Select **Common \> User Management** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Select a user ID.

3.  Click the **Security Roles** icon.
    
    **NOTE:** All the security roles for the selected user display on
    the <span style="font-style: italic;">[User
    Role](../Page_Desc/User_Role.htm)</span> page.

4.  Select the **ROLE ID** to assign to the user.
    
    **NOTE:** Multiple role IDs can be selected by using the CTRL or
    SHIFT key.

5.  Click the **Assign To Role** icon; a check mark appears in the
    **ASSIGNED** field for the selected ROLE IDs.
