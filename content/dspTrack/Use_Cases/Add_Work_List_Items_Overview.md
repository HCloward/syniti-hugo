# Add Work List Items

Work List Items, like Plan Tasks, display on the Work List unless they
are in Completed status. After work on a Plan Task or Work List Item
completes, they can be viewed on the
[<span style="font-style: italic;">Plan</span>*Task*](../Page_Desc/Plan_Task_H.htm)
page only.

Work List Items, added on the *[Work List
Setup](../Page_Desc/Work_List_Setup_H.htm)* page, are not assigned to a
plan and do not have predecessor tasks. They cannot be in a Waiting on
Dependency status and cannot have Tags assigned.

Plan tasks, added on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Plan</span>*Task* page, are assigned
to a plan and can have predecessor tasks. They can be in Waiting on
Dependency status.

Refer to [Plan Tasks Versus Work List
Items](../Page_Desc/Plan_Tasks_Versus_Work_List_Items.htm) for more
information.

On the *Work List Setup* page, Plan Tasks and Work List items can be
edited.
