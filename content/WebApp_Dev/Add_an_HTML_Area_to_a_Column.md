# Add an HTML Area to a Column

HTML Area is a Control Type that provides a tool to format text within
the field using bold, italics, bulleted and numbered lists and other
options. An HTML Area also allows the user to add a link.

Add an HTML Area control to a column on the *[Page
Columns](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Page_Columns_H)* page's *Horizontal*
View. Refer to [Add a Control Type to a
Column](Add%20a%20Control%20Type%20to%20a%20Column) for more
