    page.](../Page_Desc/User_H)*

3.  Select a user from **USER ID** list box.
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> The
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">User ID</span> list box displays
    all users registered to System Administration with security to
    dspCompose™ (i.e., who belong to a dspCompose™ WebApp Group).

4.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SEND WORKFLOW</span>
    check box to send an email to the user when a role to which the user
    is assigned is ready to be finished.

    check box to display pop-up notifications to the user from within
    dspCompose™ when a role to which the user is assigned is ready to be
    finished.
    
    **NOTE:** A user can receive a message through both email and
    notification.
    
    **NOTE:** If the user should manually check dspCompose™ for updates
    instead of being notified with a workflow email or notification,
    disable <span style="font-weight: bold;">SEND WORKFLOW</span>
    and<span style="font-weight: bold;"> SEND NOTIFICATION</span>.

6.  Click **Save**; the *Vertical* View displays.
    
    <span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">*[View the field

7.  Select a user from **Copy User ID** list box to copy role
    assignments and Org Unit assignments from an existing user to the
    new user, if applicable.
    
    **NOTE:** **Copy User ID** helps expedite the process of granting
    security to a user. It also overwrites all of the settings for the
    user being created.

8.  Click **Save**.
