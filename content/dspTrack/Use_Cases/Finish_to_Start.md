# Finish to Start

This dependency type dictates that work on the predecessor task must be
finished before work on the dependent task can start.

A user clicks Next Action on the Work List to move the predecessor Plan
Task from In Progress status to Completed status. The dependent task
status moves from Waiting on Dependency to Ready status and work on the
dependent task can begin.

When setting a Finish to Start dependency type, the planned finish date
for the predecessor task must not be a later date than the planned start
date for the dependent task. If the dates are not set correctly, an
error message displays when saving the dependency on the *Plan Task
Dependency* page.
