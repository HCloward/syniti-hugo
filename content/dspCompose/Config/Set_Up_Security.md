# Set Up Security for dspCompose™

To set up security for dspCompose:

1.  [Create User
    Accounts](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Create_User_Accounts_in_System_Administration)
    (performed by an Administrator)

2.  [Grant the user access to a WebApp
    Group](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Assign_Users_to_WebApp_Groups)
    in dspCompose (performed by an Administrator)

3.  [Grant Users Access to Post Monitor Group in
    Integrate](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Grant_Users_Access_to_Post_Monitor_Group_in_Integrate_in_System_Administration)
    (optional) (performed by an Administrator). An Administrator must
    assign users to the Post Monitor group in Integrate for them to
    successfully post using the Post Later feature in dspCompose.

4.  [Add Users to dspCompose](Add_Users_to_dspCompose)

5.  [Assign Users to Org
    Units](../Use_Cases/Set_up_Org_Units#Assign_Users_to_Org_Units)
    (optional). If using Org Units, grant user access to Org Units and
    Org Unit values.

6.  A user must also be granted access to a template role to access a
    template. Refer to [Add Users to
    Templates](../Use_Cases/Add_Users_to_Templates) for more
    information.
