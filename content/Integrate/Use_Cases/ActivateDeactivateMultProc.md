# Activate or Deactivate Multiple Processes for a Template

Integrate allows a user to quickly activate or deactivate individual
processes or all processes associated with a template.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> This overrides the
Activate or Deactivate status at the process level. 

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> This functionality should
only be used during development as the processes are activated or
deactivated without any pre-validations.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> When using dspConduct™
component with Integrate, if the scenario is in any status other than
Published, the Designer can activate or deactivate the process in
Integrate as needed to test and troubleshoot the process. Refer to
[Manage dspConduct™
Scenarios](../../../Master_Data_Mgmt/dspConduct/Use_Cases/Manage_Scenarios)
for more information about working with scenarios in dspConduct™.
