# View Dynamic Page Reports

When the user clicks **Report** on the Page Options (small gear)
drop-down, a report for the current page is generated.

**NOTE**: Support Report must be enabled for a page. Refer to the
[Enable Dynamic Page Reporting](Enable%20Dynamic%20Page%20Reporting.htm)
for more information.

If the page is in the horizontal state when the option is selected, the
report uses the *Horizontal* View and fields available on the
*Horizontal* View display on the report. If the page is in the vertical
state, the report uses the *Vertical* View and fields available on the
*Vertical* View display on the report. Using the current *Horizontal* or
*Vertical* View ensures that the report contains only the data that the
user is otherwise allowed to see on the Dynamic page.

To view a page report:

1.  Navigate to the DSPÂ® page.
2.  Click the **Page Options** icon and click **Report**.

The report displays in a new browser window.

**NOTE**: The report honors all drill-down and filter criteria. Only
visible records and fields display on the report.
