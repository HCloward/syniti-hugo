# Test Interfaces

Once an interface has been created and configured, test it to make sure
the validations, events and notifications run smoothly.

To test an interface in Automate:

1.  Select **Interfaces** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click **Vertical View** for the interface. There are two options for
    testing an interface:
      - **Debug–** Tests the interface in debug mode with full logging
        information. The interface immediately runs in the foreground.
        Debug Mode must be enabled on the *Vertical* View of the
        *[Interfaces](../Page_Desc/Interfaces.htm)* page.
      - **Execute–** Tests the interface. The interface immediately runs
        in the foreground.

**NOTE:** The Debug and Execute icons are only active when ACTIVE is
enabled for the interface.
