# View Chart Histogram

The detail row for each context available on the *[Data Quality
Dashboard](View_Data_Quality_Dashboard.htm)* page has a History option
that opens a new browser tab with a Chart Histogram that shows the
history of data quality scores for the context selected.

The bar chart displays the current month to date, and the previous six
months of history of the data quality scores based on the context
selected.

Hover a cursor over a data point on the line to view the number of
reports included in the score for the month.

The View Data icon to the right of a chart name opens a pane that
displays the alternate text descriptions of chart data in a table.

To view the Chart Histogram:

1.  Click **DQS Dashboard** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click the **History** option in any detail row.

**NOTE:** The detail rows are updated dynamically when a user selects a
particular chart and context on the *Data Quality Dashboard* page. The
Chart Histogram labels show the context being viewed.
