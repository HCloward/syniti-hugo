# Review Non Duplicate Records

Review duplicate records to decide if the record is a true non duplicate
or if the record must be reset.

To review non duplicate records:

1.  From the *Results* page, click **Non Duplicates** icon.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the NonDuplicates
    page](../Page_Desc/NonDuplicates)*

2.  Review the duplicate record pairs. There are two options:
    
    Leave the record pair as is if the Obsolete Object and Actual Object
    are duplicates.
    
    Click **Reset** icon to reset the record pair as an unresolved
    candidate so it can be reanalyzed. This action removes the record
    pair from the *Results* page. If that record pair is in the current
    set of source data, it re-appears on the *Candidates* page.
