# Configure Secure

The Secure feature enables specific legacy data fields to be encrypted.
The columns to be encrypted can be masked so that a portion of the
original data can still be used during the migration project.

Once the migration process is complete, the data is then decrypted and
sent toÂ the target ERP system via RFC (SAP only) or File format.

The Secure configuration includes the following steps:

  - [Add Keys](Add_Keys.htm)

  - <span>[Configure Secure
    Parameters](Configure_Secure_Parameters.htm)</span>
