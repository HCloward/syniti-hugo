# Set up Instances

Before moving items between instances, the source and target instances
must be indicated in the DSPÂ®. The DSP is delivered with DEV, PROD and
QA instances set up. If using one of these instance names, only the
website address needs to be updated.

Refer to [Mark Target and Source
Instances](Mark_Target_and_Source_Instances.htm) and [Configure CTS
Passwords](Configure_CTS_Passwords.htm) for more information.

To set up instances:

1.  Log in to the DSP source instance.

2.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Setup \> Instances** in the
    *Navigation* pane.

3.  Click **Add**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Instances
    page](../Page_Desc/Instances.htm)

4.  Enter a user-friendly name of the instance, for example, STG, in the
    **INSTANCE** field.

5.  Enter a brief description of the instance, for example, Staging, in
    the **DESCRIPTION** field.

6.  Enter the URL to the instance in the **WEB SITE ADDRESS** field.
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> The website address
    must contain a fully qualified address, for example, an address that
    contains "http://" or "https://".

7.  Click **Save**.

8.  Repeat all steps for the target instance.
