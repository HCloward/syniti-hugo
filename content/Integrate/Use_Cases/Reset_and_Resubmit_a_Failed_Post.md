# Reset and Resubmit a Failed Post

If a posting fails, troubleshoot the errors using information on the
*Messages* page or download the message file on the *Message File* page.

Resubmit the post after correcting any errors. Click **Reset** for the
process post on the *Process Post* pageâ€™s *Vertical* View on the
**Posting** tab, then post the data again.

After resetting a post it can be submitted again regardless of its
status prior to the reset, and regardless of the reason for the failure.
