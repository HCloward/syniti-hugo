# View the Business Value Dashboard

dspMonitor’s Business Value Dashboard displays the cost of failures due
to data quality issues.

The charts on the dashboard display the cost of errors for the user’s
group, objects, and applications, and displays a report of the top 10
reports with the highest error cost.

For data to appear on the Business Value Dashboard, the cost of the
failure must be set at the report level. If necessary, the currency must
be updated from US Dollars at the WebApp level. Refer to [Configure the
Business Value Dashboard](Configure_the_Business_Value_Dashboard)
for more information.

To access the dashboard, select **dspMonitor \> Dashboard \> Business
Value Dashboard** in the *Navigation* pane.
