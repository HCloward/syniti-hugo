# Set up Security for Integrate

To set up security, an Administrator:

1.  Creates User Accounts
2.  Creates Security Roles
3.  Assigns Users to Security Role
4.  Assigns WebApp Groups to Security Role

A user can then:

5.  [Create Integrate Categories](Create_Categories.htm) in Integrate.
    
    An Administrator can then:

6.  Assign the security key for the newly created Integrate Category to
    the security role.

**NOTE**: Security keys must be assigned to a role every time a new
category is created in Integrate.
