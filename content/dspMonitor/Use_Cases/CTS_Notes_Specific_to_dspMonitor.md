# CTS Notes Specific to dspMonitor™

The following objects and tables can be used in the CTS process:

  - Filter
  - Group
  - Object
  - Report
  - Report Repository
  - ztDQSThreshold
  - ztQualityDimension
  - ztSigmaLevel

The Report Repository and Group must already exist in the Target system
prior to moving the Report object.

If Objects are CTS’ed, they must exist in the Target system.

The Report Repository, Object, Group and Filter can be sent
independently.

Refer to System Administration for detailed information regarding the
[CTS process](../../../Platform/Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/CTS_Overview).
