# Use Collect with Full Construction

Collect registrations are added to take the snap shot of the Target
Source added in Target Design automatically if the default WebApp
(Construct) and the default data source (sdbDSPConstruct) are used.

Tables created when a Full Construction Source is synced to Map can be
viewed in Collect on the
*[Tables](../../../Platform/Collect/Page_Desc/Tables_H.htm)* page after
the tables have been downloaded. Refer to [Tables
Overview](../../../Platform/Collect/Use_Cases/Register_and_Use_Tables.htm)
for more information about downloading tables.

To access the Target in Collect to schedule the table download, an
Administrator must have added the sdbDSPConstruct key to the Collect:
Targets security role definition.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: If the Construct page is
built manually, the table for the page must be registered in Collect and
downloaded. Refer to [Tables
Overview](../../../Platform/Collect/Use_Cases/Register_and_Use_Tables.htm)
for more information.
