# Add a Calendar

In dspTrack™, calendars are used to schedule status calculations. Refer
to [Set Parameters for Schedule Status
Calculations](../../dspTrack/Use_Cases/Set_Parameters_for_Schedule_Status_Calculation.htm)
for more information. A calendar named Default is included when
dspTrack™ is installed. Additional calendars can be added for
dspTrack™.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> When an MS Project file is
imported into dspTrack™, a calendar is added with the Project name at
the start of the calendar name.

dspConduct™ uses the dspConduct™ default calendar to perform SLA
calculations. Refer to [Set up SLA notifications in
dspConduct™](../../../Master_Data_Mgmt/dspConduct/Config/Set_Up_SLA_Notifications.htm)
