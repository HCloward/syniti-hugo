# Detect Locales

Locales are installed with the platform and set date, number, and
currency formats. Users view data in this format based on their
associated Locale ID. The Locale ID can be set:

  - On the *[Users](../Page_Desc/Users_H.htm)* page’s *Vertical* View by
    an Administrator
  - On the Settings page by the user
  - On the *[Locales](../Page_Desc/Locales.htm)* page by the user by
    clicking the Detect Locales button

**NOTE**: If the user’s Locale is not available in the Locale ID list
box on the *Settings* page, the use can click the Detect Locales button.
The DSP® checks the browser settings and adds them to the DSP® if they
do not already exist.
