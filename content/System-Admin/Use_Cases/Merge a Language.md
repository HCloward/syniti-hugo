# Merge a Language

This feature is used by customers who are upgrading to 6.0 who have a
custom language that must be merged with a DSPÂ® language delivered with
6.0. For example, if a user had entered Spanish translations prior to
6.0, the Merge Language feature allows the user to merge the
translations into the Spanish language delivered with 6.0.

To merge a language:

1.  Select **Admin \> Configuration \> Setup \> Languages**.

2.  Click **Add**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Languages
    page](../Page_Desc/Languages.htm)

3.  Enter the name of the language in English in the **LANGUAGE** field.

4.  Enter the name of the language as written in the language in the
    **NATIVE NAME** field.

5.  Click **Save**.

    row.

7.  Select the language to merge into from the **Target Language ID**
    list box.

8.  Click **Save**.
