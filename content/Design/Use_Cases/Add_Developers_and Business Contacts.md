# Add Developers and Business Contacts

Users can be assigned as a Business Contact or a Developer at the Target
or Source level in Target Design and at the Object level in Console.
Refer to [Add Individual Target
Contacts](../../Console/Use_Cases/Add_Target_Contacts_to_Objects.htm#Add2)
for more information.

Two types of contacts can be assigned to a Target and Source.

  - *Developers* approve mappings on the *[Mapping
    Approval](../../Map/Page_Desc/Mapping_Approval_H.htm)* page
    submitted for a Target-Source in Map on the *[Field
    Mappings](../../Map/Page_Desc/Field_Mappings_H.htm)* page.
    Developers must also have security set up to view the *Mapping
    Approval* page. Refer to [Approve or Reject
    Mappings](../../Map/Use_Cases/Approve_or_Reject_Mappings.htm) for
    more information.
  - *Business Contacts* are used for reporting purposes and
    automatically receive public reports for the Target–Source in
    Transform. Refer to [Report
    Delivery](../../Transform/Use_Cases/Report_Delivery_Overview.htm)
    for more information.

**NOTE:** Developers and Business Contacts can be added to a Target or
Source regardless of the Target’s Design Status.
