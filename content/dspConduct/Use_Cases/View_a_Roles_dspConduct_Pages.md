# View a Role's dspConduct™ Pages

A Designer can view request-related pages (on
the <span style="font-style: italic;">[dspConduct
Tasks](../Page_Desc/dspConduct_Task_H)</span> page) that are
available in dspConduct™ and can be assigned to roles based on role
type. For example, the [Request Post
Process](../Page_Desc/Request_Post_Process) page can be assigned to
any roles with the role type of Post.

A Designer uses this information while configuring role and task
combinations.

Tasks cannot be edited on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[dspConduct™
Tasks](../Page_Desc/dspConduct_Task_H)</span> page.
