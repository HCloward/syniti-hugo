# Register a Collect Download as an After Post Rule

When posting data to a target system, a Template Administrator can
register an After Post Rule to a process template. The rule runs after
the process template executes successfully and before the next process
template begins processing (if posting with a multi-template process).

A Collect rule downloads a Collect source - target - table registration.
When registering a Collect Download as an After Post Rule, the source,
target, and table to download must be selected. Once selected, the
source and target Where clauses can be [manually
entered](Register_a_Collect_Download_After_Post_Rule_Manually.htm) or
[automatically built at run
time](Register_a_Collect_Download_After_Post_Rule_that_is_Built_Automatically.htm).

Overview](Register_After_Post_Rules_to_a_Process_Template_Overview.htm)
