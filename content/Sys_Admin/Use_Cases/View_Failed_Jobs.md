# View Failed Jobs

When the Services icon on the Site toolbar is yellow, there is a failed
job(s) for a component on the site. View the failed job to determine the
cause of the failure and to acknowledge the failed job.

To view failed jobs, users must be a member of the Administrator, Power
Designer or Power User WebApp groups for System Administration.

There are four ways to view failed jobs:

1.  Click the yellow **Services** icon on the Site toolbar.

2.  Click **Admin \> Resources \> Jobs (Failed)** in the *Navigation*
    pane; the [Jobs (Failed)](../Page_Desc/Jobs_Failed_H.htm) page
    displays.

3.  Click **Admin \> Resources \> All Jobs** in the *Navigation* pane;
    the [All Jobs](../Page_Desc/All_Jobs_H.htm) page displays

4.  Click **Admin \> Resources \> Monitor** in the *Navigation* pane and
    then, click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Failed</span> icon
    for a job type; the [Failed Jobs](../Page_Desc/Failed_Jobs_H.htm)
    page displays.

Once the failed job has been debugged and fixed, acknowledge the job.
Refer to [Acknowledge Failed Jobs](Acknowledge_Failed_Jobs.htm) forÂ more
information.
