# Horizontal vs. Vertical Views

Every dynamic page in DSPÂ® must have either a *Horizontal* and/or a
*Vertical* View.

The basic principle of page design is to keep the *Horizontal* View
simple, and have more lengthy elaborate data on the *Vertical* View.
Multi-row rendering of the data is responsive and less overwhelming to
the user, while the slower computation / dense data displays on the
*Vertical* View, which is loaded on demand.

For example, if a table contains many columns for a single record, to
avoid any horizontal scrolling and foster a better user experience,
create *Horizontal* and *Vertical* Views. The *Horizontal* View contains
the basic information about the columns, while the *Vertical* View
contains the columns on the *Horizontal* View and all additional
columns.
