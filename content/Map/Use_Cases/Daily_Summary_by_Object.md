# Daily Summary By Object

This chart displays the number of mappings per status for all field
mappings for all targets in the Object selected on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Objects](../Page_Desc/Objects_map)</span>
page for the day.

The Total Mappings is the count of active fields in the target.

Hover a cursor over a data point to view the number of field mappings in
that status for the Object for that day.

Click the line for an Object to drill down to the
*[Targets](../Page_Desc/Targets_H_Map)* page to view the
targets that are in the Object.
