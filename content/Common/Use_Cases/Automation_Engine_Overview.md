# Automation Engine

The Automation Engine allows for the programmatic creating and
processing of instructions, for example, creating rules in Collect.
Instructions can only be automated from within a single data source.

The Automation Engine hierarchy is as follows:

  - **Instruction** – an individual instruction to execute

  - **Task** – a collection of instructions

  - **Task Group** – a collection of tasks that are executed in a
    specific order

This use case includes the following topics:

  - [Register Public Plugins](Register_Public_Plugins)

  - [Create Instructions](Create_Instructions)

  - [Copy Instructions](Copy_Instructions)

  - [Create Tasks](Create_Tasks)

  - [Define Instructions for Tasks](Define_Instructions_for_Tasks)
