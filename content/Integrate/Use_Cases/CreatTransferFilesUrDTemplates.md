# Create and Transfer Files for User Defined Fixed Width or Delimited Templates

When a User Defined template type is assigned to a process and posted,
Integrate generates flat files in XML, Delimited, or Fixed Width format
and can then transfer the files to a designated data source.

The user must manually define the structures and fields for a User
Defined template.

Select the **User Defined Template Type** (**Delimited**, **FixedWidth**
or **XML**) on the templateâ€™s *Vertical* View.

**NOTE**: Refer to [Create and Transfer an XML
File](CreateTransferXMLOverview.htm) for information about this template
type.
