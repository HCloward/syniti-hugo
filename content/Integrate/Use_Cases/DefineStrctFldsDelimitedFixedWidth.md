# Define Structures and Fields for Delimited or Fixed Width Templates

<span id="Post Data Using UDF or Fixed Width Steps" class="popUpLink">Review
the steps in the process. </span>

Manually define the structures to be written to the file and the fields
included in each structure on the *Structure* and *Structure Field*
page.

The registration of structures and fields for Delimited and Fixed Width
templates follows the same process.

To register structures and fields for a template on the **General** tab
of the *Vertical* View of the *Template* page:

1.  Click **Define**.
    
    **NOTE**: Each structure will have its own view defined when mapped
    to a process and will be written to its own line in the file. If one
    complete record has five lines to be written to the file, create
    five structures. 
    
    *View the field descriptions for the Structure page.*

2.  Click **Add**.

3.  Enter a value in **PRIORITY**.
    
    **NOTE**: The priority is the order in which the line will be
    written to the file.

4.  Enter a structure name in **NAME**.

5.  Enter details about what type of data should be mapped to the
    structure in **DESCRIPTION**.

6.  Click **Save**.

7.  Click the **Fields** icon.
    
    **NOTE**:  A field is a unique piece of data that will be written to
    the file when the template is posted via a process. 

8.  Enter a value in **PRIORITY**.
    
    **NOTE**: The priority of a field is the order in which the field
    will appear in the file. 

9.  Enter a field name in **NAME**.

10. Enter details about the field in **DESCRIPTION**. 

11. Enter a value in **LENGTH**.
    
    **NOTE**: This field does not display for Delimited templates. For
    Fixed Width template types, this data is required for each field in
    the structure.

12. Click **Save**.
    
    **NOTE**: The **Fields** icon displays the number of fields added to
    each structure.

13. Navigate to the *Template* page *Vertical* View.

14. Click Documentation tab.

15. Click **Report**.

16. Verify the structures and fields have been added to the template
    correctly.
