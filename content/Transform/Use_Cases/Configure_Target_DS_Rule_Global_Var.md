# Configure Target Data Services Rule Global Variables

For each of the Data Services Jobs, the global variables needed to pass
parameters into Data Services are automatically populated. The global
variables are passed to the Data Services Job at runtime and the Job is
executed based on parameters specified in the global variables.

The global variables (date formats, time formats, etc.) are populated
from the object level Target where they were specified. The global
variables can be updated on the *[Target Data Services
Rules](../Page_Desc/Target_Data_Services_Rules_H.htm)* pageâ€™s *Vertical*
View, if needed. Do not change the Wave, Process Area, object or Target
global variables because they are hardcoded values that tie specifically
to the GUIDs of those elements.

**NOTE:** Do not edit the values for the Wave, Process Area, Object or
Target variables.
