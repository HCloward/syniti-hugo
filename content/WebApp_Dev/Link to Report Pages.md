# Link to Report Pages

Dynamic and Report pages are typically rendered in a horizontal or
vertical mode when the page first displays. This allows a user to sort
or filter the page before clicking the Report option from the Page
Options drop-down.

A Page Designer can use the Link to Report option to link directly to
the report version of a page to bypass the *Horizontal* or *Vertical*
View. Once this option is enabled, when a user clicks the link in the
column, the Report page displays.

To enable the Link to Report column property:

1.  Select **Admin \> WebApps** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click the **Pages** icon for a WebApp.
3.  Click the **Column Properties** icon for a page..
4.  Click the link under **LINK TO PAGE** column.
5.  Enable the **Link To Report** check box; the page automatically
    saves.

If the Column Property is for the boaReport Reserved Column, the Link To
Report field is also available on the *Vertical* View of the Column
Property on the *[Page
Columns](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Page_Columns_H)* page. Refer to
[Configure boaReport Reserved
Column](Configure%20boaReport%20Reserved%20Column) for more
information.
