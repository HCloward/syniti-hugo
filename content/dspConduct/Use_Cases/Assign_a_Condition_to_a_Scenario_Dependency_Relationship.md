# Assign a Condition to a Scenario Dependency Relationship

A data-driven dependency condition identifies a condition within a field
when processing a scenario that determines whether a subsequent
dependent scenario or role is processed. A Designer completes this task.

Conditions must be added before they are assigned to a scenario
dependency relationship. Refer to [Add Data-Driven Dependency Conditions
to a Category](Add_Data_Driven_Dependency_Conditions.htm) for more
information.

**NOTE:** A new condition can be added on the *[Scenario Dependency
Condition
Assignment](../Page_Desc/Scenario_Dependency_Condition_Assignment.htm)*
page. Conditions must be deleted on the
*[Conditions](../Page_Desc/Conditions.htm)* page*.*
