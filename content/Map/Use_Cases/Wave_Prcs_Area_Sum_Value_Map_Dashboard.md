# Wave and Process Area Summary Value Mapping Dashboard

In value mapping, an individual value in a Source field is configured to
be converted to a value that the Target system accepts in the Target
field. For example, the Source system may store USA in the Country
field, while the Target system uses the value US. Value mapping converts
the Source value to the Target value for every occurrence of the Source
value in the field.

Each chart in the dashboard allows the user to drill down to data in the
level below it in the hierarchy to view data in increasing granularity.

Refer to [Perform Value Mapping](Perform_Value_Mapping_Overview) for
more information.

A summary of value mapping status associated with the Wave and Process
Area by day, week and month is also provided on these charts.

Refer to [View Dashboards in Map](View_Dashboards_in_Map) for
general information about chart features.
