# Copy Work Hours Across Work Days

Calendars are used in dspTrack™ and dspConcut™ components. Refer to [Use
a Calendar](Use_a_Calendar.htm) for more information.

A user can copy work hours from one work day across all the work days
for a calendar instead of entering work hours for each work day in a
week.

For example, the work hours for a Monday are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. These
work hours can be copied across the remaining work days in the week, so
that all work days in the calendar also have work hours from 9:00 AM to
5:00 PM.

If a work day has multiple sets of work hours, these shifts are copied
across all work days in the calendar.

To copy work hours:

1.  Select **Common \> Tools \> Calendar** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Select **Work Days** for a calendar.

3.  Select a work day.:
    
    **NOTE:** A work day has the WORK DAY check box enabled.
    
    **NOTE:** When a work day is selected, the work hours display on the
    *Work Hours* page.

4.  Click **Copy Work Hours** on the *Work Day* page.
    
    **NOTE**: Copying work hours has no effect on non-working days. If a
    non-working day is selected on the *Work Day* page, the Copy Work
    Hours icon is disabled.

Any work hours already set for other work days are removed and replaced
with the copied work hours.
