# Create a Secure Key

To create a secure key:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Modules \> Keys** in *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Add<span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span>**
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Keys
    page](../Page_Desc/Keys.htm)

3.  Enter a value in **KEYIDENTIFIER** field.
    
    **NOTE:** The KEY IDENTIFIER is the name used to identify the key
    during the encryption and decryption processes. It should be
    recognizable by the Data Migration teams.

4.  Enter a value in **KEYPASSWORD** field.
    
    **NOTE:** The KEY PASSWORD should be a
    **<span class="underline"><span style="color: #ff0000;">strong</span></span>**
    password. A strong password is at least eight characters in length
    and contains a capital letter, a number and a special character,
    e.g., @lantaGA2013. The password is encrypted using DSPÂ® encryption
    and stored in the table, but is not visible on the web page. Once
    created, the password cannot be modified. Refer to
    [Forgotten/Incorrect
    Passwords](Forgotten_Incorrect_Encryption%20Passwords.htm) for more
    information.

5.  Update <span style="font-weight: bold;">KEY ALGORITHM</span> list
    box if the default value is not applicable.

6.  Click **Save.**
