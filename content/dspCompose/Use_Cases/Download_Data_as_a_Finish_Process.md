# Download Data as a Finish Process

As part of the Finish process, dspCompose™ can be configured to download
the data posted by a dspCompose™ request to tables in a database (often
dgSAP). The data should download when a user clicks **Finish** for the
Post role on the *Request (Roles)* page.

If the data is not being downloaded, use the *Request Role (Finish
Download)* page to run the process manually to assist while
troubleshooting.

To run the process manually:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Request Role (Finish Download)** on the
    *Navigation <span style="font-style: normal;">pane</span>*.

2.  Click **Finish Download** for a request; a confirmation message
    displays.
    
    **NOTE**: The value in the **REQUEST ID** field on the *Request*
    page identifies the request.

3.  Click **Ok**.

The data should download to the designated tables.

Refer to [Register Tables for Download as a Finish
Process](Register_Tables_to_Download_as_a_Finish_Process_Using_Collect.htm)
for more information.
