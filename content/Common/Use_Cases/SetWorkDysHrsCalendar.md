A work day can have multiple sets of work hours. However, a set of work
hours cannot:

  - Overlap the hours of any other set of work hours
  - Start during hours already specified in another set of work hours
  - Have a finish time that is earlier than its corresponding start time

The finish time for one set of work hours can be identical to the start
time of another set.

The following start and finish times are valid work hours for a work
day:

|             |             |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Start Time  | Finish Time |
| 12:00:00 AM | 9:00:00 AM  |
| 9:00:00 AM  | 5:00:00 PM  |
| 5:15:00 PM  | 11:59:00 PM |
