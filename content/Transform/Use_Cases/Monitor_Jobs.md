# Monitor Jobs

Any jobs that processed or are processing in the background display on
the
*[Monitor](../../../Data_Quality/dspMonitor/Page_Desc/Monitor_H.htm)*
page. Users can view tasks assigned to the job and, in the event of a
job failure, perform a job restart or continue the failed job.

To monitor jobs, select **Monitor** in the *Navigation* pane.

The following features are available when monitoring jobs:

  - **Tasks** – Navigates to the *[Tasks](../Page_Desc/Tasks.htm)* page
    where tasks associated with the job display.
  - **Continue** – Continues to process a failed job. After a job fails,
    fix the error and then click **Continue** to restart the job at the
    fixed rule.
