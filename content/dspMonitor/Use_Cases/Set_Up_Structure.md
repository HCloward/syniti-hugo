# Set Up Structure

dspMonitor™ is organized by report repositories, groups, reports and
users. Reports are registered to report repositories and then to groups.
To allow for different report settings based on group requirements, the
same report can exist in multiple groups. To access the group’s reports,
users are registered to a group.

Setting up the dspMonitor™ consists of the following steps:

1.  [Create and Register Report
    Repositories](Register_Report_Repositories.htm)
2.  [Register Collect Targets to a Report
    Repository](Register_Collect_Targets_to_a_Report_Repository.htm)
