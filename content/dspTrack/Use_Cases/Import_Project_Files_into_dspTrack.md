# Import Project Files into dspTrack™

dspTrack™ allows a user to import project files into a dspTrack™ plan,
quickly adding tasks and other plan related information.

Project files must be in the form of Excel files (in .xlsx format) which
have been exported from Microsoft Project, or MS Project 2012 files (in
.mpp format).

Projects can also be exported from dspTrack™ to be updated in MS
Project, then imported into dspTrack™ to update project data. Refer to
[Export a Project File](Export_a_Project_File.htm) for more information.
