# Task Status by Project

This chart displays the percentage of tasks in each status (Ready,
Waiting on Dependency, In Progress or Completed) per project. The
percentage of tasks is based on the number of tasks in each status in
the project compared to the total number of tasks in the project.

Hover a cursor over a section of the bar that represents task status and
the count of tasks in that status display for that project.

Click a project bar to drill down to the [Task Status by
Plan](Task_Status_by_Plan) chart.

Refer to [View the Dashboard in
dspTrackâ„¢](../Use_Cases/View_Dashboards_in_dspTrack) for general
information about the type of data that displays on charts.

To access the chart, click **Dashboard** in the *Navigation* pane.
