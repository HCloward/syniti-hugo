# Hide a Column from Download

A Page Designer can set the columns available for download for a page in
a custom WebApp. This setting is useful, for example, if columns contain
sensitive data that must not be distributed, or if data is duplicated
across columns.

After the user selects the Download option on the Page Settings menu,
the fields available for download display on the Fields tab. By default,
all columns on a page can be downloaded. A Page Designer can set the
Control Status of a column so that the column is hidden on the Fields
tab and is not downloaded.

**NOTE**: If none of the columns on a page in a custom WebApp should be
downloaded, uncheck the Support Download check box on the
*[Pages](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Pages_H.htm)* page. Refer to [Assign
Page Properties to a Dynamic Page](Assign_Page_Properties.htm) for more
information.

To prevent a column from being downloaded:

1.  Navigate to the page in the custom WebApp.

2.  Click the **Change Settings** icon in the Site toolbar.

3.  Select **Design**.

4.  Click the **Column Properties** icon.

5.  Click **Add**.

    **COLUMN** list box.

7.  Select **Download** in the **VIEW TYPE** list box.

8.  Click **Save**; *Vertical* View displays.
