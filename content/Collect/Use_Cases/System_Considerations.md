# System Considerations

Before data is extracted, there are hardware and software considerations
that impact its efficiency.  Many of these are described in the
[BackOffice Associates® Solutions Software Requirements and Hardware
Sizing
Guide](https://support.boaweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000353327-BackOffice-Associates-Solutions-Software-Requirements-and-Hardware-Sizing-Guide-7-0-2).
However, it is important to remember these requirements can vary
significantly based on the type and scope of a project.  Considerations
include:

  - Network hardware and bandwidth (LAN and WAN)
  - Proximity to the data center
  - Number of clients and usage patterns
  - System configuration
  - Database design
