# Hide a Page Column on a Report

Column properties control what data (i.e., what columns/fields) are
visible on the report. A column property with a Report View Type only
applies when the page is rendered as a report. Standard column property
inheritance rules apply. For example, a Report View Type in column
property inherits from the wildcard column property.

Column properties can be used on both Dynamic page reports and Report
pages.

By default, all fields available on the DSP® page display in the report.
However, columns that display on the *Horizontal* and/or *Vertical* View
of the DSP® page can be hidden on the report.

To hide a column so that it is not visible on a report:

1.  Select **Admin \> WebApps** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Pages** icon for a WebApp.

3.  Click the **Column Properties** icon for a page.

4.  Click **Add**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Page Columns
    page](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Page_Columns_H)

5.  Select a column from **COLUMN** list box.

6.  Select **Report** from **VIEW TYPE** list box.

7.  Select **Hide** from **CONTROL STATUS** list box.

8.  Click **Save**, the *Vertical* View displays.

9.  Click **Save**.
