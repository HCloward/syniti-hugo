# Register Target and Source Data Sources

Target and Source data sources must be registered using the preferred
method in Common. Refer to [Register a Data Source in
Common](../../Common/Use_Cases/Register_a_Data_Source_in_Common.htm) for
more information.

A data source can also be registered in System Administration, but this
method is not recommended.
