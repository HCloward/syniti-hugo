# Create Dictionaries

Dictionaries contain words and their synonyms that are used to resolve
abbreviations or to normalize common industry or company-specific
abbreviations. Use dictionaries sparingly.

The DSP® is delivered with four dictionaries:

  - Address – Common abbreviations for street and state names (e.g.
    Street -\> Str)

  - Company Name– Common abbreviations for businesses (e.g. Management
    -\> Mgmt)

  - Name – Common abbreviations for names (e.g. William -\> Will)

  - Phone – Common abbreviations for phone numbers
