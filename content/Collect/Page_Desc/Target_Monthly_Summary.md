# Target Monthly Summary

This chart displays the duration of time in seconds it took to refresh
all active tables from all registered data sources for a target database
for each month. On this chart, a user can view monthly fluctuations in
duration of table refreshes that may be caused by changes in system
resources, tables being added or deleted from the refresh, or other
factors

Hover a cursor over a data point and the month, target name and number
of seconds display.

Targets are destination databases (registered as data sources in the
platform) where tables are refreshed with source data using Collect.

Each target is represented as a separate line on the chart.

Refer to [View Dashboard in
Collect](../Use_Cases/View_Dashboard_in_Collect.htm) for general
information about how data displays on dashboards.

To access the chart in Collect, click **Summary Dashboard \> Monthly**
in the *Navigation* pane.
