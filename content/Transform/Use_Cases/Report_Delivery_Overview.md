# Report Delivery Overview

Report Delivery allows Business users who do not typically log in to the
DSPÂ® to log in, view and download the migration reports that are of
interest to them.

Report data access can be restricted for sensitive information or can be
limited by report filters or target report segments.

This section provides information for two types of users. An
Administrator [configures Report
Delivery](Configure_Report_Delivery.htm). Business Users [view the
reports](View_Reports.htm).

Any target, target source, or target Data Services report can be used on
Report Delivery pages.

Transform does not display live data on reports, but stores a cached
version of the last run of the report to display on Report Delivery
pages.

To view reports:

  - The user must be a Business User or Developer at the
    [object](../../Console/Use_Cases/Add_Target_Contacts_to_Objects.htm)
    level in Console or at the
    [target](../../Design/Use_Cases/Add_Developers_and%20Business%20Contacts.htm)
    level in Target Design.
  - The report must be published. Refer to [Publish Reports to Report
    Delivery Pages](Publish_Reports_to_Report_Delivery_Pages.htm) for
    more information.
  - The user must be granted access to the report. Refer to [Assign a
    User to a
    Report](Grant_Users_Access_to_Reports_and_Sensitive_Data.htm#Assign_a_User_to_a_Report_on_Report_Delivery_Pages)
    for more information.
