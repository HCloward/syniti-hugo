# Copy a Target in Target Design

A Target can be copied to a Wave, a Process Area, and an Object to be
used as the basis for a new Target.

When a Target is copied, its fields and sources and all associated
settings, including basic rules and complex rules, are also copied to
the Object. The design status does not affect the ability to copy a
Target.

**NOTE**: The destination Wave, Process Area and Object for the copy
must be a different Object than the currently selected Object.

To copy a Target in Target Design:

1.  Select **Design** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Objects** icon on the
    *[Design](../Page_Desc/Design.htm)* page.

3.  Click the **Copy Targets** icon for an Object.

4.  Click **Edit**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Select Destination Object for
    Targets
    page](../Page_Desc/Select_Destination_Object_for_Targets.htm)

5.  Select an Object in the **Destination Object** list box.
    
    **NOTE**: A Wave, a Process Area, and an Object must be selected to
    copy a Target.

6.  Click **Save**.

7.  Click the **Targets to Copy** icon.
    
    **NOTE**: The number on the button indicates the number of Targets
    that will be copied. All Targets in the Object are selected by
    default.

8.  Enable or disable check boxes as appropriate for the Targets that
    should be copied.

9.  Click **Back** to return to the *[Select Destination Object for
    Targets](../Page_Desc/Select_Destination_Object_for_Targets.htm)*
    page.
    
    **NOTE**: The number on the Targets to Copy button indicates the
    number of Targets selected on the *[Copy
    Targets](../Page_Desc/Copy_Targets.htm)* page.

10. Click **Copy Targets**.
    
    **NOTE**: This icon is disabled if the Destination Object list box
    is blank.

To access the copy of the Target:

1.  Select the Destination Object in the Context bar by clicking the
    down pointing arrow next to the current context name.
2.  Click
    <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: bold;">Design</span>
    in the Context bar.
3.  Click the
    <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: bold;">Targets</span>
    icon.

The Target displays on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Targets](../Page_Desc/Targets_H_Design.htm)</span>
page with the original Target name appended by \_copy.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: If multiple copies of the
same Target are copied to the same Destination Object, each copied
Target name will be followed by \_copy and a number incremented by 1
(\[Target name\]\_copy1, \[Target name\]\_copy2 and so on).
