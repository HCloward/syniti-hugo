# Add a Mass Change Custom Link to a Custom Page

If Mass Changes should be allowed to the request data, the MassChange
Custom Link must be defined for the Data Entry page so that a user can
access the *Request Mass Change* page from the Data Entry page. An
Administrator can use the Custom Link WebApp Customization feature in
System Administration to add the link.

Refer to [Assign a Custom Page to a Template
Role](Assign_a_Custom_Page_to_Template_Role.htm) and [Create Custom
Pages and Views for the BAPI
Process](Create_Custom_Pages_and_Views_for_the_BAPI_Process.htm) for
more information about creating custom pages.
