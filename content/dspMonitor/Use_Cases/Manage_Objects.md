# Manage Objects

dspMonitorâ„¢ is delivered with a standard set of reports organized by
object (which is a categorization). Reports can be configured by object
and then published to a group to facilitate the manual process of adding
reports to groups. These reports are delivered in the DGReports
Repository and can be published to any group(s).

This use case consists of the following topics:

  - [Create Objects and Publish Reports to
    Groups](Create_Objects_and_Publish_Reports_to_Groups)
  - [Register Object Reports](Register_Object_Reports)
  - [View Your Objects](View_Your_Objects)
  - [View Your Object Reports](View_Your_Object_Reports)
