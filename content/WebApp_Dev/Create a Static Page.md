# Create a Static Page

A static page can display text only or can link to traditionally created
web pages stored and registered on the DSP® server.

Static pages can be used to display information that does not frequently
change, such as help text or directions on how to use a WebApp. A static
page is often the first page that displays when a user clicks the WebApp
name in the *Navigation* pane.

A static page can also be used to open web pages that were not created
in the DSP®, though this feature is not commonly used. A user can create
an HTML page and assign it as a static source DSP® page. When the static
page opens, the manually created HTML page displays.

To create a Static page:

1.  Select **Admin \> WebApps** on the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click the **Pages** icon for a WebApp and click **Add**.

OR

1.  Click the WebApp name in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Change Settings** icon on the Site toolbar , select
    **Design**, and click **Add.**
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Pages
    page](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Pages_H)

<!-- end list -->

3.  Enter a page description in the **DESCRIPTION** field.

4.  Select **Static** in the **PAGE TYPE** list box.

5.  Click **Save**; the *Vertical* View displays.

6.  Enter the text that displays on the page in the **Static Source**
    field.

7.  Select a menu from the **Horizontal Menu ID** list box, if using a
    menu other than the default.
    
    **NOTE:** The Horizontal menu displays to the left of the page when
    the page is accessed. The standard menu is {component name} :
    Switchboard.

8.  Click **Save**.
