# Set the Default Context for a User

An Administrator user can set the context (a Wave and Process Area) that
a user accesses by default. The current context displays n the Context
bar. Refer to [Context, the Context Bar, and
Navigation](../../../Migration/dspMigrate/Context_Navigation.htm) for
more information.

To set the default Wave Process Area ID:

1.  Log in as the Administrator user.

2.  In Console, select **Advanced Configuration \> User Context
    Setting** in the *Navigation* pane.

3.  Click **Edit** for the desired user.

4.  Select a Wave Process Area ID from the **DEFAULT Wave Process Area
    ID** list box.

5.  Click **Save**.

**NOTE:** Each time the selected user logs in, the **DEFAULT Wave
Process Area ID** chosen displays in the Context bar.
