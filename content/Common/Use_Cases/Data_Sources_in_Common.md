# Data Sources in Common

While data sources can be registered in System Administration by an
Administrator, [registering a data source in
Common](Register_a_Data_Source_in_Common) is the preferred method.
Refer to [How the DSP Uses Data Source
Types](../../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/HowDSPUsesDataSourceTypes) in
System Administration for more information on Data Sources.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Data Services data sources
must be registered in Common.

When a data source is created in System Administration, it is available
in Common on the <span style="font-style: italic;">[Data Source
Registry](../Page_Desc/Data_Source_Registry_H)</span> page.  

However, after the initial record is added to Common, changes made to
data sources in System Administration are not applied to data sources in
Common. Changes made to data sources in Common are reflected in data
sources in System Administration. Refer to [Sync Data Sources in Common
and System
Administration](Sync_Data_Sources_in_Common_and_System_Administration)
for more information.
