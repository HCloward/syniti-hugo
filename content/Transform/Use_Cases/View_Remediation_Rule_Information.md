# View Remediation Rule Information

The *Target Remediation Overview* page is a centralized reporting
location for Remediation-based operations. Depending on how the user
accesses the page, Transform displays rule information for a selected
Target report or for all reports for a Target which have either an
active fixed remediation rule or at least one active remediation rule.

To access the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target Remediation
Overview</span>page, click the **TR** icon for the selected Target on
the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Targets](../Page_Desc/Targets_H.htm)</span>
page's <span style="font-style: italic;">Horizontal</span> View.

To access the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target Remediation
Overview</span> page for a specific Target report, click the **Reports**
icon for the Target, and click the **TR** icon for the report on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Target Reports</span> page in the
child pane.

**NOTE:** The TR icon displays active when remediation rules exist for
the Target. 

The *Target Remediation Overview* page contains information about the
Target report’s Remediation metrics for both remediation rules and fixed
remediation rules.

On this page:

  - Click **Edit** to access the *[Target Remediation
    Setup](../Page_Desc/Target_Remediation_Setup.htm)* page to view and
    configure the Target report’s remediation rule or fixed remediation
    rule settings. Refer to [Register Target Remediation
    Rules](Register_Target_Remediation_Rules.htm) and [Correct Errors in
    Target Data with Fixed Remediation
    Rules](Correct_Errors_in_Target_Data_With_Fixed.htm) for more
    information.
  - In the FIXED REMEDIATION column, view information related to the
    fixed remediation rule, including the number of records affected by
    the rule. If the fixed remediation rule has not been run, the count
    displays the number of records on the report. Click the **Count**
    button to view all remediated records.
  - In the REMEDIATION RULES column, view information including the name
    of the stored procedure and the number of records remediated. Record
    Count displays the number of records affected by the remediation
    rule’s execution. Records Remediated displays the number of records
    that were remediated. These counts will not necessarily be the same
    value.
