# dspMonitor™ Overview

dspMonitor™ is the analytical component of the DSP® that facilitates
reporting on and maintaining high quality master data. It allows
business users to:

  - Pull data from the ERP database on a scheduled or an on-demand basis
    to constantly review data, especially data that could cause a
    significant business process interruption  

  - Establish data quality thresholds and view data quality scores and
    status

  - Organize and display quality metric reports via web access or other
    formats for process improvement

  - Identify and send errors (via workflow notifications) to business
    users for cleansing

dspMonitor™ is delivered with a standard set of reports. Users can also
create custom reports to fit their business needs.
