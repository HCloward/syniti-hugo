# Connection Types

The methods for extraction considered in this section rely upon two
connection types:

1.  **Open Database Protocol (ODBC) –** The most common and universally
    used connection type and an industry standard. ODBC can connect to
    any database management system for which an ODBC driver is installed
    or available.
2.  **Remote Function Call (RFC) –** The protocol used to call functions
    within SAP and the standard interface for communication between SAP
    Systems.
