# Getting Started with DSP® Security for Custom Components

To get started with DSP® security for custom components:

1.  [Create User
    Accounts](Create_User_Accounts_in_System_Administration.htm)
2.  [Create WebApp Groups](Create_Groups_Security.htm) if not using
    delivered groups
3.  [Set Page Security for WebApp
    Groups](Set%20Page%20Security%20for%20WebApp_Groups.htm)
4.  [Create Security Definitions](Create_Security_Definitions.htm)
5.  [Create Security Roles](Create_Security_Roles.htm)
6.  [Assign Users to Security Role](Assign_Users_to_Security_Roles.htm)
7.  [Assign WebApp Groups to Security
    Role](Assign_WebApp_Groups_to_Security_Role.htm)
8.  [Assign Keys to Security Role](Assign_Keys_to_Security_Role.htm)

To set up user-specific security that allows users to view a more
granular layer of data, complete the above steps plus add a
user-specific key. Refer to [Establish-User Specific Security
Definitions](Establish_UserSpecific_Security_Definitions.htm).

When developing a new component, grant developer security via Security
\> WebApp Security \> Users. Refer to [Assign Users to a WebApp for
Custom Application
Development/Customizations.](AssignUsersWebAppCustomAppDev.htm)

To add non-developer users (i.e., end users) to the new component, add
the WebApp group and users to the security role. Refer to [Assign WebApp
Groups to Security Role](Assign_WebApp_Groups_to_Security_Role.htm) and
[Assign Users to Security Roles](Assign_Users_to_Security_Roles.htm) for
detailed information.
