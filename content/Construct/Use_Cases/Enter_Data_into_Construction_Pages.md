# Enter Data into Construction Pages

The Construct page is used to enter or modify data required for the
Target ERP system that doesn’t currently exist in the Source system.

Construct eliminates the inconsistency of maintaining multiple
spreadsheets and gives a single location where users can update or
directly enter data. 

To enter data into the construction pages:

1.  Select **dspMigrate** in the
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Navigation</span> pane.

2.  Select **Construct** in the Context bar.

3.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Targets</span>icon on the
    *[Construct Launch](../Page_Desc/Construct_Launch)* page.

4.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Construct Pages</span>
    icon for a Target.

5.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Construct Page</span>
    icon for a page in the child pane.

6.  Click **Edit**.

7.  Populate the applicable fields.
    
    **NOTE:** If populating fields generated by Map, Map creates a rule
    to link the fields to the correct location in Transform. For manual
    rules, manually link fields to Transform.

8.  Click **Save**.
