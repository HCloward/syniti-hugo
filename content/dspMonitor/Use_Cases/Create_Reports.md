# Create Reports

There are three types of reports:

  - **Error** – backbone of dspMonitor™. Error reports display data
    errors and inconsistencies that require attention. When creating an
    error report, include a column called "boaError." This column adds
    the filter "boaError=1" to signify that those are the error records
    returned by the report.

  - **Information** – might not display the exact list of errors.
    Information reports help the business analyze and understand the
    data and identify potential problems.

  - **Metric** – displays various target ERP metrics.

For instructions and best practices for creating reports, refer to the
dspMonitor™ training material.
