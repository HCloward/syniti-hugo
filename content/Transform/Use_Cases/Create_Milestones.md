# Create Milestones

Use Milestones to capture metrics at a fixed point in time. Snapshots of
record counts for Targets, Sources, rules and reports are recorded. This
information can be used to chart progress and stored for documentation
purposes.

To create a milestone in Transform:

1.  [Access Transform](../Config/Access_Transform.htm).

2.  Click **Tracking** on the *Navigation* pane.

3.  Click **Add**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Milestones
    page.](../Page_Desc/Milestones.htm)*

4.  Enter a milestone name in the
    <span class="StyleListNumberBold" style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION</span>
    field.

5.  Enter a description in the
    <span class="StyleListNumberBold" style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span>
    field.

6.  Click the **CAPTURED ON** field to select a date.

7.  Click
    <span class="StyleListNumberBold" style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>.

8.  Click the
    <span class="StyleListNumberBold" style="font-weight: bold;">Capture</span>
    icon for a milestone to capture the milestone.
    
    **NOTE:** The Capture icon is inactive while the Objects icon is
    active to ensure a milestone can only be captured once.
    
    **NOTE:** A milestone must be captured for data to display on the
    Change Summary Dashboard and the Trend Summary Reports.

9.  Click the
    <span class="StyleListNumberBold" style="font-weight: bold;">Objects</span>
    icon for a milestone to view metric details captured for this
    milestone.
