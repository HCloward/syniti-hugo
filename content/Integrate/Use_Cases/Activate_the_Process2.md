# Activate the Process

<span id="Post Data using a BAPI Steps" class="popUpLink">\>Review the
steps in the process. </span>

After process template loops and field mappings have been configured,
activate the process. On the *Process* page, click
**ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE**.  An active process displays a green icon in the
**ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE** column and the **ACTIVE** check box is enabled.

To activate a process, each template assigned to the process must be
active, and each template assigned to the process must have at least one
view assigned.

**NOTE**: Once a process has been activated, it must be deactivated to
be edited.

**NOTE**: Integrate allows a user to activate or deactivate all
processes associated with a template from the *Template Processes* page.
Refer to [Activate or Deactivate Multiple Processes for a
Template](ActivateDeactivateMultProc.htm) for more information.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> When using dspConduct™
component with Integrate, if the scenario is in any status other than
Published, the Designer can activate or deactivate the process in
Integrate as needed to test and troubleshoot the process. Refer to
[Manage dspConduct™
Scenarios](../../../Master_Data_Mgmt/dspConduct/Use_Cases/Manage_Scenarios.htm)
for more information about working with scenarios in dspConduct™.

Changes can no longer be made to process templates. The **Postings**
icon is activated and process posts can be added or edited.
