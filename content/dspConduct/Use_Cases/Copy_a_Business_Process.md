# Copy a Business Process

A Designer has the ability to copy a business process for the purpose of
modifying the newly created business process for use with content data.

When a business process is copied, all data elements as well as
relationships (scenarios within the business process and scenario role
SLAâ€™s) existing at the business process level are copied.

A business process can be copied whether it is active or not.
