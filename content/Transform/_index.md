# Transform Overview

Transform is a component of dspMigrate™ that provides measurable
advantages in the Data Preparation phase of a data migration project.
The tool cleans, manipulates and reports on data, and exports the data
so that it can be loaded into a target ERP system using a load tool.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> When processing anything
in Transform (except for clicking the Execute button on an individual
report or rule), it is run as a background job. From the individual
report or rule level, if the Process button is clicked, the individual
item will be queued as a background job as well.
