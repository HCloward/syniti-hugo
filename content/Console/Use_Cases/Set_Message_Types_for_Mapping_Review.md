# Set Message Types for Mapping Review

When a mapping is submitted or reset on the *[Field
Mappings](../../Map/Page_Desc/Field_Mappings_H)* page, the Developer
assigned to the mapping’s target and source can be notified that a
mapping must be reviewed.

Refer to [Add Developers and Business Contacts to a Target or
Source](../../Design/Use_Cases/Add_Developers_and%20Business%20Contacts)
for more information.

Depending on a setting on the *[User Message
Type](../Page_Desc/User_Message_Type)* page in Console, the workflow
notification can be sent via email or displayed as a notification from
within the product. A Developer can also select an option to receive no
notifications.

To set the message type for a Developer in Console:

1.  Select **Advanced Configuration \> User Message Type** in the
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Navigation</span> pane.
    
    **NOTE**: A user can set message types for that user’s account
    only.  An Administrator can set message types for all users who
    have access to dspMigrate™.

2.  Click **Edit**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the User Message Type
    page](../Page_Desc/User_Message_Type)

3.  Select an option in the **MESSAGE TYPE ID** list box.

4.  Click **Save**.
