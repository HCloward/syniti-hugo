# dspTrack™ Overview

dspTrack™ is a project tracking tool used to ensure project tasks are
completed according to a project schedule and to alert managers when
tasks and projects are in danger or being late or are late. The
parameters for schedule status calculation can be fine tuned so that
managers and resources can most effectively meet project deadlines.
Dependency types for tasks ensure that tasks occur in the right order to
complete the project efficiently.

dspTrack™ also allows resources to enter their progress on tasks and to
receive email notifications when a task is ready to be worked on, is
late, or is in danger of being late.

Project data can be imported from a Microsoft Project or Excel file or
can be manually entered.

<span>Work List Event Rules and Validations can be implemented at the
plan, Plan Task, Work List Item or tag level to further customize how
tasks move through the workflow.  </span>

dspTrack™ integrates with Microsoft Project so that updates to the
Critical Path in Microsoft Project are reflected in dspTrack™.
