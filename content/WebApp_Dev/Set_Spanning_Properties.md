# Set Spanning Properties

Spanning Properties is a method to reduce horizontal scrolling and
present data efficiently. In some cases there may not be enough fields
or differences to warrant creating a *Vertical* View. Use Spanning
Properties to create a line break on the column headings to shift some
fields down making the record two lines. For example, if the record has
10 columns, the Spanning Properties Line Break can be set on the
6<sup>th</sup> column. Columns 1-5 display on the top line and columns
6-10 display beneath columns 1 -5. Prioritize important text-based
contextual information on the left, and actions on the right.

In some cases the width of the column might need to be adjusted to avoid
character wrapping. The Column Span feature determines the width of the
column. For example, if the Column Span is set to 2, it spans 2 columns.

If the Description is a text area and contains a sentence, it would not
make sense to make it wider, it would be better if it was taller. The
Row Span feature determines the height of the row. For example, if the
Row Span is set to 2, the Row is 2 rows high.

Column Span can be used in any case; however Row Span must only be used
when a Line Break is set.

Column spanning is available for all control types except tab and Label.

To set the Spanning Properties:

1.  <span id="Column Properties Navigation" class="popUpLink">Access the
    *Page Columns* page</span>'s *Vertical* View.

2.  Click **Edit**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Page Columns
    page](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Page_Columns_H)*

3.  Click the **Spanning Properties** tab.

4.  Enter a value in the **Column Span** field or the **Row Span**
    field.

5.  Click the **Line Break** check box to enable it.
    
    **NOTE:** Any columns to the right of this column display on the
    next line.

6.  Click **Save**.
