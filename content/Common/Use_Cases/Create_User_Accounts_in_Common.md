# Create and Manage User Accounts in Common

An Administrator user can add user accounts, send temporary passwords to
newly added users, and reset passwords in Common. Using Excel
Integration on the *[User
Management](../Page_Desc/User_Management_H.htm)* page, an Administrator
can also add and update user account data for multiple accounts at one
time. Refer to [Use Excel
Integration](../../Excel_Int/Use_Excel_Integration.htm) for more
information.

Users can also be added in System Administration, but Common is the
recommended method for Help Desks and Call Centers. The password
maintenance process is more streamlined in Common. In System
Administration, the Administrator must add a password for the user. In
Common, password maintenance is the user’s responsibility. Once the user
account is created, there is no difference between a user account added
in Common and System Administration.

To create a user account, an Administrator:

1.  [Creates a User Account in Common](Create_a_User.htm)
2.  [Send a Temporary Password to a New
    User](Send_a_Temporary_Password_to_a_User.htm)
3.  [Assigns a User to a Security Role in
    Common](Assign_a_User_to_a_Security_Role_in_Common.htm)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Creating a User Account is
the first step in setting up security in the DSP®. In many components,
additional tasks are needed to grant a user access to that component.
