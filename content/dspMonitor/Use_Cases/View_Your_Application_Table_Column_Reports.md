    page](../Page_Desc/Your_Application_Table_Column_Reports_H.htm)*

5.  Click the **View** icon to view the report data.
    
    Or
    
    Click the **Download a file** icon to download the report data in a
    file.

**NOTE:** Download a file is only active if the report has been
processed.

**NOTE:** Be aware of Microsoft Excel and the Platform record
limitations for large reports. The Excel limitation is 65K records for
large reports for version 2003 and older, and roughly 1 million records
for version 2007. If Excel 2007 is used to generate large reports,
increase the Report Autogenerate Size parameter (Configuration \>
Parameters). The Platform limits a file size of 10 MB to be uploaded; a
file over 100K records is typically over 10 MB. Users can also generate
CSV or TXT files to support larger records sets with smaller file sizes.
dspMonitorâ„¢ also supports xlsx if the client has the correct version of
Microsoft Office.
