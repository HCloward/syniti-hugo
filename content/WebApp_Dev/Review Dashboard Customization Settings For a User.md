# Review Dashboard Customization Settings For a User

A system administrator can review customization settings for a user for
dashboards.

The *Customization Review* page shows each user that has access to the
page and whether they are inheriting the customization applied to the
page via the default shipped values, with an extension or via the role
they are assigned to or via a specific user extension. The page could
have multiple customizations applied and the User takes precedence over
the Role, and the Role take precedence over the Default. The values are
changed on the *Page Customization* page using the Default, Role or User
buttons to link to the underlying pages.

A user can review, for all users with access to the WebApp, whether a
user views the default dashboards or whether the user has a different
dashboard assigned by role or user assignment.

Refer to [Customize Dashboard Page
Display](Customize_Dashboard_Pages) for more information.

To review customization settings for dashboards:

1.  Select **Admin \> Customization \> WebApp Customization** in the
    *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Pages** icon for a WebApp.

3.  Click the **Review** icon for a page.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Customization Review
    page](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Customization%20Review)

4.  Click the **Review** icon for a user ID.
