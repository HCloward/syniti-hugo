# Stop a Running Index

Indexing a table can take a long time, so the option to stop a running
indexing is available.

To stop a running index:

1.  Select **Admin \> Resources \> Indices** in the *Navigation* pane.
    
    **NOTE**: If the index is running, the status displays as Queued and
    the Stop button is enabled.

2.  Click **Stop** to cancel indexing.
