# Add Custom Criticality Levels

Criticality can be set for a Target field and is used for reporting
purposes.

Three criticality levels are installed by default: High, Medium and Low.
These DSP-supplied values cannot be edited or deleted.

New levels can be added. Once saved, these levels are available for
selection in the CRITICALITY list box on the *[Target
Fields](../Page_Desc/Target_Fields_H_Target_Design.htm)* page.

To add a criticality level in Target Design:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Criticality** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Add**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Criticality
    page](../Page_Desc/Criticality.htm)*

3.  Enter the name of the level in the **CRITICALITY** field.
    
    **NOTE**: This name displays as an option in the CRITICALITY list
    box on the *Target Fields* page.

4.  Enter the order of the level in the **PRIORITY** field.

5.  Enter a description of the level in the **DESCRIPTION** field.

6.  Click the **ACTIVE** check box to uncheck it, if needed.
    
    **NOTE**: The check box is enabled by default. If the check box is
    disabled, the criticality level is not available in the CRITICALITY
    list box on the *Target Fields* page.

7.  Click **Save**.
