# Add a Task to a Role

The <span style="font-style: italic;">[Role
(Task)](../Page_Desc/Role_Task.htm)</span> page allows a Designer to add
existing tasks to a role.

Each task is performed on a web page designed to collect and validate
information required to support the scenarios and business processes to
which that role is assigned. The web page is developed at a client’s
site and is stored in the Content WebApp.

The pages available for a task are those pages in the Content WebApp set
at the Category level in the Default Web App ID field on the
[Category](../Page_Desc/Category_H.htm) page.

Before performing this step, [add a role](Add_a_Role.htm) and [add a
task](Add_a_Task.htm).

This step is required to complete setup for a role. A role must have at
least one task assigned.

Refer to [Manage Tasks](Manage_Tasks.htm) for general information about
tasks.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: One or more different
tasks can be added to a role. A particular task can only be added to a
role once.
