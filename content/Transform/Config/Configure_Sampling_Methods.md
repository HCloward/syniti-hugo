# Configure Sampling Methods

Transform is delivered with several methods to audit data. These
sampling methods are used on Target audit reports to select random rows
for the users to verify data. This process allows rows from very large
Targets to be selected at random for quality verification prior to, or
subsequent to, a data load.

Sampling methods delivered with the platform cannot be edited, but a
sampling method can be added. To modify a Sampling Method, delete the
record and add a new one.

To add a sampling method in Transform:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Setup \> Sampling Methods (Setup)** in the
    *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Add**.
    
    [*View the field descriptions for the* Sampling Methods *(Setup)
    page.*](../Page_Desc/Sampling_Methods_Setup.htm)

3.  Enter a name in the **DESCRIPTION** field.

4.  Verify the **ACTIVE** check box is checked.

5.  Click **Save**.

6.  Click the **TOGGLE ACTIVE** button to enable/disable the sample.

7.  Click the **Sample Size** icon to view specific sample methods for
    the designated ranges.
