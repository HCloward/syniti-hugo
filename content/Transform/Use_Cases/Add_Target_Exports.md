# Add Target Exports

Transform does not load data into an ERP system; it stages data for
export. Target exports are the last sets of rules to move the Target
data to a location so that it can be staged for export to an ERP system
using a loading tool, such as a direct load program or CTS.

This load program is set on the [*Target
Exports*](../Page_Desc/Target_Exports_H.htm) pageâ€™s
<span style="font-style: italic;">Horizontal</span> View in the **Load
Type** field.

The Target export view must be manually created in SQL server along with
the Target export tables. The view and table must exist before
registering the Target export in Transform.

**NOTE:** BackOffice follows a strict naming convention for creating
names that each member of the object can understand. Any manually
created objects must also follow these conventions. Refer to [Naming
Conventions](Naming_Conventions.htm) for more information.

**NOTE:** Transform writes export files to the path defined in the
Export Path field on the Transform tab of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Vertical</span> View of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Parameters](../../Console/Page_Desc/Parameters.htm)</span>
page in Console. All export files are written to the path:
C:\\DSW\\Export\\\<Wave Name\>-\<Process Area\>\\\<Target Name\>.  

To register a Target export to a Target in Transform:

1.  Click the **Targets** icon on the *[Process Area
    Launch](../Page_Desc/Process_Area_Launch.htm)* page.

2.  Click the
    <span class="StyleListNumberBold" style="font-weight: bold;">Exports</span>
    icon for a Target.

    Transform. Options include Database, Integrate, Local File and
    Protected Package.
    
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> If a user saves a
    Target export with an export type of Local File, an Assemble
    tab-delimited package is created and registered to the export.
    
    **NOTE:** If the export type is Integrate, refer to [Use an
    Integrate Process as an Export
    Type](Use_an_Integrate_Process_as_an_Export_Type.htm) for more
    information.

    Assemble (formerly known as "CranPort") to view details about the
