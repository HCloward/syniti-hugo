# Generate Documentation

Transform allows users to generate and download audit reports for
Targets, Target Sources, and objects. In addition, technical
specifications and reconciliation reports can also be created and
downloaded for Targets.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> The Generate Documentation
check box must be checked on the Transform tab of Console's
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Parameters](../../Console/Page_Desc/Parameters.htm#Transform_Tab)</span>
page to use this feature.

The Audit report lists information about the object, Target, or Target
Source, including the Source import and Source rules, Target rules,
Target reports, and Target exports. Each of these includes the object
name, a description, an action date, and the number of records included
in the Source, report, or export, or, in the case of rules, the number
of records affected by the Insert, Update, or Delete rule.

The Reconciliation report displays the number of records exported from
the Target and the number of records that were reconciled.

The Technical Spec report displays detailed information about the
Target, Target Source, Target Source rule, Target Source audit rule,
Target Source reports, Target rules, Target audit rules, Target reports,
Target remediation rules and Target exports. All records list the object
name, priority and status. Other details are included depending on the
object type.
