# Use Data Quality Dashboard

A Business Data Owner or Director of Data Governance can view the Data
Quality Dashboard to evaluate the quality of data and drill down into
areas of data quality concern.

The dashboard and charts only allow access to detail data to which the
logged in user has access. Refer to [Configure User Settings, Reports
and Filters](Configure_User_Settings_Reports_and_Filters.htm) for more
information about setting up user access.
