# Change Request Status

Active, inactive and archived requests have different
<span id="dspCompose Request Status" class="popUpLink">request
statuses</span>.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: A rule can be run when a
request status is changed to Cancelled or Deleted. Refer to [Register
Rules to Template-level
Events](Register_Rules_to_Template%20level_Events.htm) for more
information.

To delete or cancel a request:

1.  Select **Requests** in the *Navigation
    <span style="font-style: normal;">pane</span>*.

2.  Click **Vertical View** for a request.

3.  Click **Change Status** tab.

4.  Click **Cancel Request**; a confirmation message displays.
    
    *Or*
    
    Click **Delete Request**; a confirmation message displays.

5.  Click **Ok**.

**NOTE**: When a request is cancelled or deleted, users with access to
the request will receive an email notification and a notification from
within dspCompose™.

The cancel and delete request processes are reversible by changing the
request status. A request that is deleted or cancelled cannot be reset.

**NOTE**: The delete request process can be reversed if the archive
service page has not run. This service page runs once daily.

    **<span id="dspCompose Request Status" class="popUpLink">REQUEST
    STATUS</span>** list box.

4.  Click **Save**.

A request can be reset to a usable state if an error occurred during
processing.
