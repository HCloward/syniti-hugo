# Profile a Target Table in dspMonitor™

Common provides a quick and easy method to perform an assessment of data
contained within a table.

In dspMonitor™, on the *Vertical* View of the *[Your Application
Tables](../Page_Desc/Your_Application_Tables)* page, a user can run
Common’s profile feature on the selected table, then view the table data
and the results of the profile analysis.

For detailed information about profiling, refer to [Profile Data
Source](../../../Platform/Common/Use_Cases/Profile_Data_Source).
