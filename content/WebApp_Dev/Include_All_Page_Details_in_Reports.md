# Include all Page Details in Reports

Report Follows Link is enabled by default and generates a report for the
current Dynamic page for the *Horizontal* or *Vertical* Views.

This option is available for the Image control type only.

A report containing data from multiple pages may need to be generated.
By clicking the Page settings gear and selecting Report, the report
follows any and all page links associated with the primary page.

To generate a report of a page:

1.  <span id="Column Properties Navigation" class="popUpLink">Access the
    *Page Columns* page</span>'s *Vertical* View for the control that
    will link to the report.

2.  Click **Edit**.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Page Columns
    page](../Sys_Admin/Page_Desc/Page_Columns_H)*

3.  Click report page link in the **LinktoPageID** field; the *Page
    Column Links* page displays.

4.  Click the **Report Follows Link** check box.
    
    **NOTE:** Report Follows Link instructs the web spider to include
    the WebApp page details in the report. This option can be applied to
    all other links on a page.

5.  Navigate back to the *Page Columns* page's *Vertical* View.

6.  Click **Save**.
