# Work with Plan Tasks

Plan Tasks are imported into dspTrack™ when a project file is imported.

Refer to [Import Project Files into
dspTrack™](Import_Project_Files_into_dspTrack).

Plan Tasks, user assignments to Plan Tasks, and task dependencies can
also be added manually.

Plan Tasks and Work List Items display on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List Setup</span> page. To
differentiate between the two, a Plan Task has a Project and Plan name
in the PROJECT and PLAN field on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List Setup</span> page. These
fields are blank for Work List Items. Refer to [Plan Tasks versus Work
List Items](../Page_Desc/Plan_Tasks_Versus_Work_List_Items) for more
information.
