# Work with Work List Items

Work List Items are ad hoc tasks that can be added outside of project
and plans.

Work List Items are different from Plan Tasks in that Work List Items:

  - Are not assigned to a plan or project
  - Do not have predecessor tasks, and are never in the status Waiting
    on Dependency
  - Are added on the *Work List Setup* page
  - Cannot be copied
  - Cannot have tags assigned
  - Only display on the *Work List Detail* page when the status is
    Completed
  - Do not have Warn Thresholds applied
  - Do not have a duration or Unit of Measure set
  - Are never included on the Critical Path
  - Are never milestones

Work List Items, like Plan Tasks, display on the Work List unless they
are in Completed status. After work on a Plan Task completes, the Plan
Task can be viewed on the *PlanTask* page and the Work List Detail page.
After work on a Work List Item completes, the Work List Item can be
viewed on the *Work List Detail* page only.

**NOTE:** Plan Tasks cannot be edited on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List Setup</span> page. Changes
to Plan Tasks can be made on the Plan Task pages only (Project \> Plans
\> Plan Tasks).

Plan Tasks and Work List Items display on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List Setup</span> page. To
differentiate between the two, a Plan Task has a Project and Plan name
in the PROJECT and PLAN field on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Work List Setup</span> page. These
fields are blank for Work List Items. Refer to [Plan Tasks versus Work
List Items](../Page_Desc/Plan_Tasks_Versus_Work_List_Items.htm) for more
information.
