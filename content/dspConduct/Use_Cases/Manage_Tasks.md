# Manage Tasks

A task defines a unit of work and is associated with the web page where
the work is performed. The web page is designed to collect and validate
information required to support the scenarios and business processes to
which that role is assigned. The web page is developed at a clientâ€™s
site and is stored in the Content WebApp.

Tasks are added to roles. Refer to [Add a Task to a
Role](Add_a_Task_to_a_Role) and [Manage Roles](Manage_Roles) for
more information.

Tasks are assigned a task type to identify the type of work associated
with the task and to control which tasks can be registered to roles.
Refer to [Role Types and Task Types](Role_Types_and_Task_Types) for
more information.

A task can have supporting documentation uploaded that can be used or
displayed within the request when it is executed. Refer to [Upload
Documentation at the Task
Level](Upload_Documentation_at_the_Task_Level) for more information.
