# Edit Rule Bindings

Rule Binding descriptions display in workflow emails, on the report
accessed through the [Report Data
Viewer,](../Page_Desc/Report_Data_Viewer.htm) and in the Excel file sent
as an attachment to a workflow email.  A description provides
supplemental information about the rule so that users who view reports
based on data that failed the rule can better understand what the failed
data shows.

The Recommendation field stores information about how to resolve records
that fail for this rule and rule binding.

The Implication field stores information about the implication of failed
data for this rule and rule binding, including downstream issues or
other rule and rule binding combinations that may be affected.
