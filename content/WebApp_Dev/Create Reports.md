# Create Reports

The DSP® supports rendering a page or collection of pages as a report. A
report is a read-only representation of the data. Any Dynamic DSP® page
can be rendered as a report. A single report can contain data from one
or more DSP® pages. Data from a single page can be organized using
report groups.

There are two types of reporting:

  - **Dynamic Page Reports** – A report invoked on any Dynamic page for
    which the Support Report option has been enabled. A new browser
    window displays the report. When the user clicks **Report** on the
    Page Options drop-down (small gear menu on every page), a report
    containing the data from the current page is generated. The report
    honors all drill down and filter criteria. Data in the report is
    sorted the same way as it is on the page.
  - **Report Pages** – Report pages accessed when the user clicks
    **Report** in the *Navigation* pane. Report is one of the several
    page types supported by DSP®. A report page honors many of the page
    and column properties that a Dynamic page honors. Reports, however,
    are read-only. Any properties that apply exclusively to the add or
    edit modes do not apply to a report.

There are two ways to format reports, depending on how the report needs
to be customized:

  - **Column Properties** – Uses the Report View Type and Control Status
    to hide fields. Not every field on the DSP® page may need to display
    in a report.
  - **Report Groups** – Used to customize the layout of a report by
    organizing data into a hierarchy. Use Report Groups to add page
    breaks and hide empty fields.
