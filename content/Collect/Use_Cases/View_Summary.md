# View Summary

The refresh process can be monitored to view which tables have been
successfully downloaded, when the download process completed, or when an
error occurred.

To monitor download activity, click **Summary** in the *Navigation*
pane. Use these  pages to monitor activity:

**[Job Summary](../Page_Desc/Job_Summary)** –View activity organized
by download status, either Completed or Error.

[Job Detail](../Page_Desc/Job_Detail_H) – View all activity for all
download statuses.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Target Summary</span> – View activity
for an entire target. Active Tables, Refreshing Tables and Error Tables
counts are updated as activity occurs.

  - To monitor the refreshing tables, navigate to
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary \> Target Summary</span>
    and click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">REFRESHING
    TABLES</span> link.
