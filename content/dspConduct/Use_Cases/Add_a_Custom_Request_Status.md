# Add a Custom Request Status

A Designer has the option to add custom request statuses.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span>  The Content WebApp must
provide all code to process and assign these statuses.

Refer to [Manage Request Statuses
Overview](../Config/Manage_Request_Statuses.htm) for more information.

To add a custom request status in dspConduct™:

1.  Select <span style="font-weight: bold;">dspConduct</span> **\>
    Configuration \> Setup \> Request Status** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span>.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Request Status
    page.](../Page_Desc/Request_Status.htm)

3.  Enter the status name in the
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">REQUEST STATUS</span> field.

4.  Select an image to reflect the status from the **IMAGE** list box.

5.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">EDITABLE</span> check box
    to enable it if needed.
    
    **NOTE:** If the check box is enabled, a request in this custom
    status can be edited by a role who has access to the request.

6.  Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ARCHIVABLE</span> check
    box to enable it if needed.
    
    **NOTE:** If the check box is enabled, a request in this custom
    status can be archived. By default a request is archived after it
    has remained in a request status for 30 days.  

7.  Click the **ROLE ACCESS** check box to enable it if needed.
    
    **NOTE:** If the check box is enabled, a request in this custom
    status can be processed by a role who has access to the request.

8.  Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>.
