# Set Up Headers and Footers for Transform Reports

The headers and footers that display on Transform reports can be
customized in Console to include information that is generated when the
report is written to a file, such as generated date, total number of
pages, or path and file name. A user can also enter static text to
include in the header or footer.

How headers and footers display can also be customized in many ways.
Transform reports do not require headers or footers. Reports can also
have a header or footer only. Text or data can display in the left,
center or right of headers and footers, or in any combination of the
three.

The same headers and footers are used on all Transform reports, though
they can be updated at any time.

Use two pages in Console to set up headers and footers.

  - Use the *[Report Headers / Footers
    (Setup)](../../Console/Page_Desc/Report_Headers_Footers_Setup)*
    page to add the text or data to appear in the header and footer.

**NOTE:** Console allows a user to add multiple headers and footers.

  - Use the **Transform** tab on the
    *[Parameters](../../Console/Page_Desc/Parameters)* page to set
    the header and footer to use for reports.

The following values are available to use in headers and
footers:

|                |                                                                                                                                                                        |
