# Update Completed Status of Records

A service page runs once an hour to update the status of completed
records for each Construct page.

A user can also manually update the stats to view the current status.

This task is performed in Target Design for a Target Source with a
Source data source of {Full Construction}.

**NOTE**: Completed records are those that were completed according to
validations added for the Construct page at the client’s site. Refer to
[Track Construction
Status](../../../Platform/Common/Use_Cases/Track_Construction_Status.htm)
for more information.

To update record counts in Target Design:

1.  Click **Design** from the Context bar.
2.  Click the **Targets**icon on the
    *[Design](../../Design/Page_Desc/Design.htm)* page.
3.  Click the **Sources** icon for a Target.
4.  Click the **Vertical View** icon for a Target Source with a **SOURCE
    DATA SOURCE** of {Full Construction}.
5.  Click **Update Stats** in the Page toolbar.

Updates are reflected in the Full Construction Details section of the
*Vertical* View.
