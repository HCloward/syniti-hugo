# Value Mapping Weekly By Check Table

This chart displays the number of weekly changes made to value mappings
for the check tables selected on the *[Value
Mapping](../Page_Desc/Value_Mapping)*page.

The number in the x-axis is the number of the week in the year. For
example, 2014-01 is the first week in the year 2014.

Hover a cursor over a data point to view the number of changes to value
mappings for that week.

Click a data point to open the *Value Mapping* page to view the status
of each check table’s value mapping. The MAPPED PERCENT field displays
the mapping status for each check table.

Refer to [View Dashboards in Map](View_Dashboards_in_Map) for
