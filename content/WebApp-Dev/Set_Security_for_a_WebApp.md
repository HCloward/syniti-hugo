# Set Security for a Custom WebApp

When a new WebApp is created, the User and PowerUser WebApp groups are
automatically generated with default assignments. The user that created
the WebApp is added to the PowerUser WebApp group. New pages added to
the WebApp are also assigned to the PowerUser group.

Business processes often require new WebApp groups to be registered with
more stringent security to the visibility and the control (add, edit,
delete) of sensitive data. This section describes how to assign specific
access to pages and menus through the Security and Design security group
functions, creating a secured business environment. The user creating
the secured environment must have access to both Security and Design
security groups. Some companies may require two individuals to perform
these functions.

**NOTE**: These steps must be performed by the Security Administrator
and Designer.

To set security for a custom WebApp at a high level:

**Security Administrator**

1.  [Create WebApp
    Group](../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Create_WebApp_Groups_using_the_WebApp_Groups_page.htm)
2.  [Assign Users to a WebApp for Custom Application
    Development/Customizations](../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/AssignUsersWebAppCustomAppDev.htm)
3.  [Assign Users to WebApp
    Groups](../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Assign_Users_to_WebApp_Groups.htm)

**Designer**

1.  [Set Page Security for WebApp
    Groups](../Sys_Admin/Use_Cases/Set%20Page%20Security%20for%20WebApp_Groups.htm)
2.  Add WebApp Home Page to WebApp Group

Security can also be set at the column level using [column
encryption.](Column_Encryption.htm)
