# Process Requests Overview

Requests are created in dspConduct™ when a new request is added and
saved on a task page in the Content WebApp. A Role Processor uses the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Request
Role](../Page_Desc/Request_Role_H.htm)</span> page to finish roles,
indicating that the work assigned to that role is complete for the
request. Roles are based on role types. Application roles enter and
validate data for the request. Once that Application role is finished,
the Review role reviews the changes and approves or rejects them. If the
request is approved, it moves to the Post role. This user posts the
changes to the target system. Posting is handled using Integrate.
