# Add a Variant to a Task

A Designer can add a variant at the category level. If the task variant
condition is met in the Content WebApp, the column definitions defined
for the variant on the <span style="font-style: italic;">[Scenario Role
Task Column](../Page_Desc/Scenario_Role_Task_Column_H.htm)</span> page
are used when processing a request.

A Designer can also import a variant view for a category. Refer to
[Import a Variant View for a
Category](Import_Views.htm#Import_a_Variant_View_for_a_Category) for
more information.

Before performing this task, the design process must be complete and a
task must be defined in the Content WebApp. Refer to [dspConduct™ Design
Process Overview](dspConduct_Design_Process_Overview.htm) for more
information.
