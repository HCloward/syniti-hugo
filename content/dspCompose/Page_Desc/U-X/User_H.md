| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| USER ID           | Displays user ID to which roles are assigned. User must be added to System Administration before being granted role security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| SEND WORKFLOW     | If enabled, workflow emails are enabled for the user. Workflow emails notify users when they have a role that is ready to be finished. If disabled, user must log into dspCompose™ for updates instead of being notified via workflow.                                                                                                                                  |
| SEND NOTIFICATION | If enabled, the user receives a message from within dspCompose™ when a role to which the user is assigned is ready to be worked. For example, a user assigned to the Review role for a template<span> </span> receives a notification from within dspCompose™ when the Data role for that template is finished. If the check box is disabled, no notification displays. |
| Org Units         | Click to open the *User (Org Units)* page to add and delete Org Units for the user ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Templates         | Click to open the *User Template Role Access* page to grant or deny access to templates for the user ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
