# Add Data to be Included in the XML file in SQL

<span id="Create and Transfer XML files Steps" class="popUpLink">Review
the steps to create and transfer XML files. </span>

Enter the data to the SQL database that Integrate will include in the
XML file when it is generated.

Use the view name generated by the Auto Generate Database Objects
feature for each loop in the process or the view that was manually
created.

1.  Log in to SQL Server.

2.  Locate the database assigned to the process.

3.  Locate the views and corresponding tables assigned to each of the
    process template loops.
    
    **NOTE**: If Integrate created tables and views using the Auto
    Generate Database Objects feature, views are named tx\[Process Name
    Template Name Loop Name\]. Tables are named tt\[Process Name
    Template Name Loop Name\]\_Upload.

4.  Open each table and add records.

**NOTE**: The **Parent ID** ties the structure in the file to the column
in the view.

**NOTE**: If the database objects were created using the Auto Generate
Database Object feature, do not populate the **ID** field, it will be
auto-generated.
