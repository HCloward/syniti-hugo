# Configure Object Estimates

Object Estimates are factors used in calculating the estimates in
metrics reports. A standard object estimates set is delivered with
Transform that can be edited, but not deleted. Transform does not allow
new Object Estimates to be added.

To edit an Object Estimate in Transform:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Setup \> Object Estimates (Setup)** in the
    *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Edit** for an Object Type.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the Object Estimates (Setup)
    page.](../Page_Desc/Object_Estimates_Setup.htm)*

3.  Update the **COUNT ESTIMATE**.

4.  Click **Save**.
