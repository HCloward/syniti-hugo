# Modify Chart Properties

Chart properties can be modified to display the page in different ways.

Category and Value column properties are required for the chart to
render. By default, two columns from the web\*Chart view are selected as
a Category and a Value column; review these column properties for
accuracy.

**NOTE:** The settings on the 3D Chart Properties tab on the *Chart
Properties* Page are used to render a chart in 3D. The user must select
a Column or Pie chart for the tab to be visible.

**NOTE**: For Tabular chart type, the user can add a Text Box control to
any column as a means to support page links. No other controls are
supported.
