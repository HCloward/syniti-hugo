# Activate and Deactivate Data Sources

When a data source is registered in System Administration, it is
automatically registered in Common to be traced.

A Data Source can be deactivated, which is helpful to reduce resource
(memory, disk space, processing, etc.) consumption.

To deactivate a data source from being traced:

1.  Click **Analyze** in *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Trace** for Data Source ID.

3.  Click **Deactivate** on Page toolbar; the data source is no longer
    traced.
    
    **NOTE**:   Click Activate on Page toolbar to begin tracing for the
    data source. At this point, a snapshot of the database is taken and
    tracing begins.
