# Activate the Process

A Template Administrator can activate a process to use the process
template to post data.

Before performing this task, [create a
template](Create_an_SAP_Data_Services_Job_template.htm), and [add the
template to a process.](Add_the_Template_to_a_Process_DSJob.htm)

To activate a process, the template assigned to the process must be
active.

To activate the process in Integrate:

1.  Select **Categories** in the Navigation pane.
2.  Click the **Processes** icon for a category.
3.  Click the **ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE** icon for the process.

An active process displays a green icon in the ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE
column and the ACTIVE check box is enabled.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Once a process has been
activated, it must be deactivated to be edited.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Integrate allows a user to
activate or deactivate all processes associated with a template from the
[Template Processes](../Page_Desc/Template_Processes.htm) page. Refer to
[Activate or Deactivate Multiple Processes for a
Template](ActivateDeactivateMultProc.htm) for more information.

After the process is active, changes cannot be made to process
templates. The Postings icon is activated and process posts can be added
or edited.

Continue with [Post Data using an SAP Data Services
Job.](Post_Data_Using_an_SAP_Data_Services_Job.htm)
