# View Dashboards in Map

The dashboards included with Map provide visibility into:

  - Field mapping status
  - Value mapping status
  - Mapping status and rule status for Target rules and Target reports
  - Mapping status and rule status for Target Source rules and Target
    Source reports
  - Number of fields value mapped by day, week and month
  - Changes to field mappings by day, week and month

Users can view this data at the Wave and Process Area, Object, Target
and Source levels.

Field mapping status and value mapping status can also be viewed at the
Wave level.

Each chart in the dashboard allows the user to drill down to data in the
level below it in the hierarchy to view data in increasing granularity.

Some charts display the count of mappings that are in a Completed
status.  A mapping is complete after it has been approved on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Mapping
Approval](../Page_Desc/Mapping_Approval_H.htm)</span> page.

These charts also display the count of mappings in an In Process status.
A mapping is in process while it is being added or updated in Map,
waiting for approval after it has been submitted, or rejected on the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Mapping Approval</span> page.

The View Data icon to the right of a chart name opens a pane that
displays the alternate text descriptions of chart data in a table. If a
chart has a legend, click a label in the legend to hide or show that
label’s section in the chart.

Hover a cursor over each section of a bar to view the field count.

If a chart is 3D, a 3D Controls icon is available to adjust the chart
angles.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> When multiple charts
display on a dashboard, charts can be resized to view a layout more
clearly. Drag the bar to the bottom right or upper left of a chart to
change its display size.

and Rule Status](Mapping_Status_and_Rule_Status.htm) for more
