# Define Security Roles

Security roles drive user security. It is at the role level that values
for any number of security definitions (if setting up security for a
custom component), as well as WebApp group registrations, are assigned
to users.  Any number of roles can be created and the exact number and
makeup of roles will differ per implementation. 

This use case includes the following topics:

  - [Delivered Security Roles](Delivered_Security_Roles.htm)
  - [Create Security Roles](Create_Security_Roles.htm)
  - [Assign Users to Security Roles](Assign_Users_to_Security_Roles.htm)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: Users can also be
[assigned to security roles in
Common](../../Common/Use_Cases/Assign_a_User_to_a_Security_Role_in_Common.htm).

  - [Assign WebApp Groups to Security
    Role](Assign_WebApp_Groups_to_Security_Role.htm)
  - [Assign Keys <span class="Hyperlink" style="color: #0000ff;">to
    Security Role</span>](Assign_Keys_to_Security_Role.htm)
  - [Copy a Security Role](Copy_a_Security_Role.htm)
