# Use the Toolkit for Custom Development

The Tooklit is a set of tools that developers can use onsite to add
functionality to their developed pages and WebApps.

The Toolkit functionality allows for custom development to:

  - Import and Export Excel Files
  - Manipulate Files and Folders

Custom development of these features is permitted; however, it is not
supported. For detailed information on implementing a Toolkit feature
into a custom application, refer to the Toolkit Developerâ€™s Manual.

The Toolkit pages in Common are provided for two purposes:

  - To serve as an example of how to set up the Toolkit pages in custom
    applications
  - To test the Toolkit settings

This use case includes the following topics:

  - [Register Plugins to Import and Export
    Files](RegisterPluginsImportExportFiles)
  - [Import Excel Files](Import_Excel_Files)
  - [Export Excel Files](Export_Excel_Files)
  - [Copy Files](Copy_Files)
  - [Move Files](Move_Files)
  - [Copy Folders](Copy_Folders)
  - [Delete Files](Delete_Files)
  - [Delete Folders](Delete_Folders)
