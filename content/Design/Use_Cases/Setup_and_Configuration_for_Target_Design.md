# Setup and Configuration for Target Design

Before Targets can be created in Target Design, [a Wave, Process Area
and an
Object](../../Console/Use_Cases/Create_Contexts_for_Migration_Projects.htm)
must have been created in Console.

Targets can be created by importing a System Type, database, or Excel
file, or can be added manually.

To get started:

  - [Access Design](../Config/Access_Design.htm)
  - [Set Up Security for Target
    Design](../../dspMigrate/Set_Up_Security_for_dspMigrate.htm)
  - [Add Custom Requirement
    Settings](../Config/Add_Custom_Requirement_Settings.htm)
  - [Add Custom Criticality
    Levels](../Config/Add_Custom_Criticality_Levels.htm)
