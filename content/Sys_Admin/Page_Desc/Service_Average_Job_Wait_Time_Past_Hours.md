# Service: Average Job Wait Time (Past Hours)

This chart displays the average time, in seconds, a job has been
waiting. Common reasons a job may wait is because it is either behind
another job that should be running or it is behind a job that is stuck.

Jobs are grouped by resource type:

  - **Background Event –** The background service controls the job queue
  - **General –** The job is on the General queue
  - **Index –** The job is on the Index queue
  - **Service Page –** The associated Service page controls the job
    queue

Hover a cursor over a chart section to view the average wait time for a
job type.
