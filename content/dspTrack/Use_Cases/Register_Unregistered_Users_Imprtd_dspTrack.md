# Register Unregistered Users Imported into dspTrack™

When a project is imported into dspTrack™, the component attempts to
match the resources from MS Project with users registered in the
platform. When a match is found, that user is assigned to the Plan Task.

If a project is imported into dspTrack™ with users that have not been
registered in the Platform, register those users to assign them to Plan
Tasks. The work these users perform can then be tracked using the Work
List.

Unregistered users are registered at the Plan level.

To register a user:

1.  Click **Project** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click **Plans** for a project.

3.  Click **VerticalView**.

4.  Click **Security** tab.

5.  Click **Register Users**.
    
    **NOTE**: A list of unregistered users that were imported with the
    project file displays. If no users display, all users imported with
    the project file are registered in the platform.

6.  Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">USER ID</span> of the
    user to register.

7.  Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit</span>.

    **NOTE**: A name and email address must be added. Otherwise, a user
    cannot be added to the system.
    
    **NOTE**: The default password assigned to the accounts in System
    Administration for users registered here is **password**.
    
    **NOTE**: To enter information for additional unregistered users,
    follow steps 7-10.

11. Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">USER ID</span>(s) of the
    user to register in the platform.

12. Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Selected Users to

    **NOTE**: This icon is disabled if a user selects a USER ID that
    does not have a name and email address entered, or if the selected
    range of users contains a USER ID that does not have a name or email
    address entered.  

This user displays on the *Users* page in System Administration, and is
assigned t the tasks that were imported. The user’s work can also be
tracked on the Work List.

To edit the registered user:

    ID</span> field.

    current user's tasks to another user in the platform. Refer to
    [Assign a Registered User's Tasks to Another
    User](Assign_Registered_User_Tasks_Another_User.htm) for more
    information about using this feature.
