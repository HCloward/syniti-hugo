# Use Map with Full Construction

Once a user saves the {Full Construction} Target Source and clicks the
Sync to Map icon, the Source is pushed to Map as an Add Row Source.

All active fields for the Target are automatically set to the Copy
action on the *[Field
Mappings](../../Map/Page_Desc/Field_Mappings_H.htm)* page. Refer to
[Copy](../../Map/Use_Cases/Copy_Map.htm) for more information about this
action.

This Target Source is treated like any other Add Row Source in Map.
Refer to [Perform Field
Mapping](../../Map/Use_Cases/Perform_Field_Mapping.htm) for more
information.

AutoGen builds the update and insert rules based on the settings in Map.
