# Configure Conditional GUI Script Data Records

<span id="Post Data using a GUI Script Steps" class="popUpLink">\>Review
the steps in the process. </span>

Conditionals for GUI scripts contain logic used during the post process
to determine whether or not to execute steps within the GUI Script
template. Only one conditional can be configured per GUI data record.  A
condition can be applied to a single data record or can be applied to a
loop.

**NOTE**: Conditionals cannot be modified if the template is active.

To configure conditional records on the *GUI Script Data* page:

1.  Locate the GUI data record.

2.  Click **Vertical View**.

3.  Click **Conditionals** button.
    
    *[View the field descriptions for the GUI Script Conditionals
    page.](../Page_Desc/GUI_Script_Conditionals.htm)*

4.  <span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Select a field from
    **CONDITIONAL FIELD NAME** list box.</span>

5.  **NOTE**: This list contains all fields captured during the GUI
    recording (those that have the **Is field** check box enabled).

6.  Select a conditional from **CONDITIONAL TYPE** list box.

7.  Enter a value in **CONDITIONAL VALUE** field.

8.  Click **Save** .

After this template is added to a process, the data set that will be
posted will meet the conditions configured.
