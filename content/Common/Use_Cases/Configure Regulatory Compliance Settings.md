# Configure Regulatory Compliance Settings

The DSP assists clients with regulatory and corporate compliance by:

  - Restricting access to personal data (any data that can be used to
    identify a person), handled through DSP security and through purging
    data after a retention date has passed. Purging data is configured
    in Common and Collect.
  - Tracking and logging user access to this data throughout the
    product, which is configured in System Administration.

Additionally a Common Administrator can:

  - [Add custom data classifications and information types as
    needed](Add%20Custom%20Data%20Classifications%20and%20Information%20Types)
  - [Update Retention Expiration Warning
    Period](Update%20Retention%20Expiration%20Warning%20Period)
  - [Update the Retention Expiration
    Email](Update%20the%20Retention%20Expiration%20Email)
