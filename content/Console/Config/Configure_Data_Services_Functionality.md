# Configure Data Services Functionality

To use Data Services AutoGen, a user accesses Data Services pages using
the Data Services icons (Data Services Rules, Data Services Reports, and
Data Services Remediation) on the
*[Targets](../../Transform/Page_Desc/Targets_H.htm)* page in Transform.
These icons do not display by default. A Data Services repository must
be assigned to the object containing the target in Console. The Data
Services repository must be registered as a data source in the platform.
Refer to [Register a Data Source in
Common](../../../Platform/Common/Use_Cases/Register_a_Data_Source_in_Common.htm)
for more information.

2.  Click the **Process Areas** icon for the Wave containing the object.
