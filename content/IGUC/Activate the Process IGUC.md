# Activate the Process

A Template Administrator can activate a Process to use the Process
template to post data.

Before performing this task, [create a
template](Create%20an%20IG%20Universal%20Connect%20Template.htm),
[activate it,](Activate%20the%20Template%20IGUC.htm) and [add the
template to a
Process.](Add%20the%20Template%20to%20a%20Process%20IGUC.htm)

To activate a Process, the template assigned to the Process must be
active.

To activate the Process in Integrate:

1.  Select **Categories** in the Navigation pane.
2.  Click the **Processes** icon for a category.
3.  Click the **ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE** icon for the Process.

An active Process displays a green icon in the ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE
column and the ACTIVE check box is enabled.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Once a Process has been
activated, it must be deactivated to be edited.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Integrate allows a user to
activate or deactivate all Processes associated with a template from the
[Template Processes](../Integrate/Page_Desc/Template_Processes.htm)
page. Refer to [Activate or Deactivate Multiple Processes for a
Template](../Integrate/Use_Cases/ActivateDeactivateMultProc.htm) for
more information.

After the Process is active, changes cannot be made to Process
templates. The Postings icon is activated and process posts can be added
or edited.

Continue with Post Data using IG Universal Connect.
