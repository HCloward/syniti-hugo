# Configure the Path or Connection Settings for a Data Source

Configure the path or connection settings for a data source to a path or
a database, depending on the data source type.

For example, if a data source is a Local File data source type, the path
to the local directory must be configured. If the data source type for a
data source is SQL Server, the connection settings to the SQL Server
database must be supplied.

**NOTE**: Do not specify the root of a drive only (i.e., do not specify
“C:\\”) when configuring path settings. This will cause the Run File
Deletion Maintenance service page to not run properly.

To configure the path or connection settings:

1.  Select **Data Sources** in *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click *Vertical* View for the **DATA SOURCE NAME**.

3.  Click **Edit**.
    
    [View the field descriptions for the Data Sources Vertical
    View](../Page_Desc/Data_Sources_HSysAdmi)
    
    **NOTE**: The fields that display on the *Vertical* View of the
    *Data Sources* page differ according to the Data Source Type
    selected for the data source.

4.  Configure the path or connection settings depending on the Data
    Source Type

5.  Click **Save**.
