# View Your Active Requests Details

A user can access the black dspCompose Requests tab on the Quick Panel
to navigate among
<span id="dspCompose Request Status" class="popUpLink">active
requests</span> for which the logged in user has access. This tab is
available from any page in any component in the DSP®, as the Quick Panel
is always visible.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: The dspCompose Requests
tab displays if the user has security configured to access dspCompose™.
 

Refer to [Set Up Security for dspComose™](../Config/Set_Up_Security.htm)
for more information.

The number on the tab represents the number of active requests the user
can access based on template assignments.
