# View Target and Source Assignments

To view all Targets that use a Source in the context selected in the
Context bar:

1.  Select **Configuration \> Sources** in the *Navigation* pane.
2.  Click the **Targets** icon for a Source.

On this page, a user can also update the System Type ID for a data
source if one has not been set.

**NOTE**: System Types are added in Common and containÂ generic
information including keys, fields, check tables, join relationships
between tables and generic mappings for external systems (for example,
Target ERP and Legacy) being used for a data migration.

To view all Sources used by Targets in all Objects in the context,
select **Configuration \> Source** in the *Navigation* pane. Objects are
added in Console and assigned to a Wave-Process Area to create a
context. The context selected in the Context bar determines which
Objects display.
