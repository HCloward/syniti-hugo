# Enable Bulk Execution for a Page

Before Bulk Execution can be configured and performed on a page, it must
be enabled by the Page Designer for an OnValidate event that runs in the
foreground on that page.

If this type of event does not exist for the page, add it. Refer to
[Create an OnValidate Page Event for Bulk
Execution](Create_an_OnValidate_Page_Event_for_Bulk_Execution.htm) for
more information.

To enable Bulk Execution for a page:

1.  Select **WebApps** in the *Navigation* pane.

2.  Click the **Pages** icon for a **WEB APP NAME.**

3.  Click the **Events** icon for a **DESCRIPTION**.

4.  Click **Vertical View** for an OnValidate event that runs in the
    foreground.

5.  Click the **Advanced Properties** tab.\>

6.  Enable the **Support Bulk Execution** check box; the Bulk Execution
    tab displays.
    
    **NOTE:** This check box only displays for OnValidate Events.

7.  Click **Save**.
